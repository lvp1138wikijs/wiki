<p>We are very proud of our team members. One of ServerPoint's main philosophies is to over-staff, not overwork. Because we have more staff than we actually need, you will normally receive a very quick response to any ticket you open. We also train our staff well, supervise them and we are very selective as to who actually becomes part of our team.</p>
<p>First, let's tell you about the hours of operation of our team.</p>
<p><strong>Accounting and Billing team</strong></p>
<p>All accounting issues are handled via tickets only and not through the phone. The reason for this is that accounting issues may sometimes become complicated and handling them over the phone with different staff members, without any way to track the issue, is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Accounting staff hours are <strong>Monday through Friday, from 8AM to 5PM PST</strong>. Accounting issues may be handled outside those hours if, for example, your service has been shut down due to lack of payment.</p>
<p>This schedule coincides with the hours of the financial markets. Anything done outside those hours is actually not processed by the financial markets (for example, your credit card provider) until the following business day. Thus, there is no need for staff outside of that schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Sales</strong></p>
<p>Technically, ServerPoint.com does not have a dedicated sales department. Our “sales” team is actually part of our technical support department. The people you talk to for sales are not trained to try to sell you things you don't need, or lie to you to make a sale nor do they earn any commissions. They are “techies” and are knowledgeable. Thus, their hours of operation are the same as the hours of our regular support staff (more on that below).</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong></p>
<p>Various levels of our support department are open 24/7.</p>
<p>Regular technical support staff hours (Pacific time, GMT-8) for all levels of support service, including our live chat :</p>
<p>24 / 7 ( all days )</p>
<p>These hours are scheduled this way to be able to support our international customers.</p>
<p>Our definition of an emergency is your server being completely down. Please be aware that if your web site is down, or email is down, that does not mean your server is down. Each service on your server (email, database, web, etc) is handled by different pieces of software, and the problem you might be having is just that one of those pieces of software is down.</p>
<p>You will soon get an email that will teach you how to easily diagnose those problems without having to contact us. It is very important that you read, and practice, the steps in that email.</p>
<p>You will also get an email that explains our support procedures, what kind of support we offer, and more.</p>
<p>Please read those emails as we continue introducing you to our family and how we work to help you…</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The hard working team at ServerPoint.com</p>
