Why ServerPoint?
ServerPoint is a very different kind of hosting company. Here are a few of the reasons why:

- ServerPoint is run by its original founders.
- In the hosting industry, average time to resolve an issue is 24 hours. At ServerPoint, it is under one hour on average.
- We run our own network, we own the servers and operate our facility. We do not outsource those services nor are we resellers of another company. When something goes wrong, we just walk into the data center and fix it ourselves.
- We overstaff our support departments with *professionals* so that issues are taken care of quickly.
- Our ultimate goal isn't to take in investor dollars, go public, and then sell the company.
- ServerPoint's founders are tech oriented people and are directly involved with the day to day operations of the company.
- Our priority is quality. We invest more dollars per customer than most other hosting company.
- ServerPoint has always grown out of its own profit, since 1998. We are not knee deep in debt.
- No outside investors have ever been needed, thus, no third parties are influencing our decisions.
- We have fully built and ready to use spares of all hardware we use.
- We've been here for over 10 years, and will be here for the long term.
- We actually do listen to your feedback and suggestions.
- And last, you are hosting with a solid company, not a fly-by-night/basement operation.
- Stick with us. Talk to us. We'll make sure your service runs smoothly.

Our staff will begin processing your order in a little while. We are sure you will enjoy many years of quality service.
