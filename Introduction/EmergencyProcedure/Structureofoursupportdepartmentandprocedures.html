<h2>ServerPoint's Technical Support Department structure and hierarchy</h2>
<p>Our support department is made up of two departments: the Emergency Support Department, and the Software/Hardware Support Department.</p>
<h3><strong>Emergency Support Department</strong></h3>
<p>If, for any reason, your call goes to voice mail, please, leave a voice message. Voice mails go to the Software/Hardware Support Department where it will be received and acted upon within *minutes*.</p>
<p>Be aware that this department does not keep written logs of any jobs performed over the phone. For example, if your server constantly crashes, but you never open a ticket regarding that issue, then our staff will probably not know about the problem.</p>
<h3><strong>Software/Hardware Support Department</strong></h3>
<p>This department deals with everything else. They answer tickets, live chats, work with your server's operating system, schedule upgrades and hardware changes, and much more.</p>
<p>Be aware that you must open a ticket for any issue that involves having our staff log into your server. Because your server may contain your confidential data, no member of our staff will log in to it without a written authorization. Basically, opening a ticket means you are giving us such authorization.</p>
<p>All staff in this department are level 2 and level 3 staff. They can work on just about any kind of issue.</p>
<h3><strong>About our staff</strong></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, ServerPoint does not understaff its departments. Any emergency you may have will be responded to quickly.</p>
