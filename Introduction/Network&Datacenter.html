<p>Fully redundant, powered by some of the largest Internet backbones in the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>For almost two decades, our network has evolved into one of the most reliable networks that any player in the industry can provide. ServerPoint is ready to handle any kind of Internet traffic your web site may need.Our network is fully redundant. Two terabitrouters as well as terabit switches power our network. We currently have 3 providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Zayo</li>
  <li>Cogent</li>
  <li>Level3</li>
</ul>
<p>Our&nbsp;network is directly connected to Cox Communications via gigfiberlink. Cox is one of the US' largest broadband providers, right along with Comcast.&nbsp;This will speed up a bit access to our network from Cox' customers,specially, here in Las Vegas. Typically, traffic from Cox to our network is sent through Los Angeles; now, it is local traffic.</p>
<p>However, the main purpose of adding Cox to our network is that theirfiberoptic network is completely and wholly owned by Cox and isindependent fromeveryoneelses. Our other providers, such as Cogent and Level3, share some commonalities in their network here in Las Vegas, thus, creating a few single points of failure.</p>
<p>Now, if any of those single points of failure actually fail, we should still be operating fine, as we can fail over all of our traffic to Cox.</p>
