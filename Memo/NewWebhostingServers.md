We have added several new servers to handle our shared hosting service. Currently, only three servers exist: katya, elena and maya. All in Las Vegas.

Now, we have:

Nahomi and Katrina, in Amsterdam

Natasha and Ninoshka in in Ashburn

Samantha and Diana in Dallas

Vera and Anna in Las Vegas

These are all running on top of ColossusCloud.

We expect to slowly increase the selling of shared hosting via our new upcoming website and other sales strategies we are implementing. So, better to be prepared now.

As usual, these are running CloudLinux and the Litespeed web server.

When new accounts are created, they will be created in any of the servers in the United States. We plan on soon adding an option to the order process so that clients can also choose the Amsterdam location.
