There were lot many pending Open orders older than 2 weeks under the open queue which were awaiting the AF from customers. In normal cases, if an order is legit and if the Cx is really willing to have a server with us, then the AF will be provided promptly and so we don't have to wait whole long 2 weeks to have it on the open queue and delete it later on.

Please follow the procedure below for handling the Open orders from now onwards:
==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==--==â€“==

Day 1 - Order received. In case the order seems to be doubtful, send AF.

Day 3 - Make a followup to the AF ticket with the following templete:
==
Hello,

We are awaiting your response for the Authorisation form, so that that order can be activated.

Please help us combat the problem of credit card fraud. These procedures are working to make online credit card fraud a thing of the past. We kindly request your co-operation here.

We look forward to welcoming you to ServerPoint.

Day 6 - Make a second and final followup to Cx:
****
Hello,

Are you receiving emails from us?
