# WordPress Hacks | 30- April-2016


Please find below the mail sent by Peter related to Wordpress hack issue,
==========================
This is related to clients that constantly ask to restore a backup because their wordpress got hacked.

The answer is a plain and simple NO.

I just found out James is asked to do this 2 to 3 times a week, and each time, it takes hours to do this.
You are consuming James' time. And that is one thing that you can't do unless it is something very high level and extremely important. James's time is very valuable for him to spend an entire day going through backups of a shared hosting client.

THINK: does a $5-$10/mo client deserve hours and hours and hours of work from a member of our company whose time is extremely important and valuable??
So, the answer to such requests is:

>>
Unfortunately, for a case like this, we can't restore a backup. Since there is no precise way of knowing when the security vulnerability showed up on your website, and when it was exploited (there are thousands of exploits out there and we can't search for all of them within your website), it would be impossible to restore every single backup we have to then test which of those contain a Wordpress that is clean. And even if we did, it could be again be exploited within just hours, as such exploits are automated and are constantly scanning the Internet for vulnerable Wordpress installations.

The only solution is to hire a malware/hack clean up company. We recommend sucuri.net as we have worked with them. You can also hire our security and malware cleanup services.

Also, after that, we recommend you install some security plugins into your Wordpress installation, such as:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-security-and-firewall/
https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/

Also, it is extremely important that you keep WordPress up to date, specially plugins. Many plugins in the WordPress community are written by inexperienced developers who do not have the necessary knowledge to write proper, secure code. Avoid plugins as much as possible.
