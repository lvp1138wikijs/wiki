When an order arrives and one of our data center experts tells you which server they will use for the order, in the new order interface for dedicated servers, you will first "assign" that server to the order.


Note to datacenter: the server can not have any kind of note assigned to it in inventory, or else it will not show up in the order interface. Once the server is "assigned" to the order, a note will be automatically placed. Do not modify that note either.


Be aware that now, the client will specify the password for their server during the order process. Do not forget that. The password will appear in the order interface.
