 MEMO - New Affiliate Program |  September 1st 2016
 

We have introduced a new affiliate program to allow our clients, and non-clients, to receive commissions from sales referred to us.

There is a new page describing the program at the following URL:

https://www.serverpoint.com/en/affiliate/

Please read through, specially the FAQ. As you receive questions, please let Jani know so that we can consider them.

You will also notice that Kayako now has a new department called Affiliate Support. This is for affiliates to contact us whenever they need help. Make sure affiliates use it.

We will soon be uploading policies so that you are aware well of how the program works.

This is something new for us and we will be learning and evolving the program as time goes by and as we encounter situations. That is why it is extremely important that you all share what you learn from dealing with affiliates!
