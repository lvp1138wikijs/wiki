## Default Cancellation Message

```
Hi,

To submit a cancellation, please login into your client portal  from https://www.serverpointapps.com/

1. Go to Menu >> Billing.
2. Click on Hosting plan  and then choose Cancel Service option.
3. Fill out the form that will be provided. 

We will process the request once we receive it.

This way we can guarantee the safety of a client's site and the speed of the process by preventing an impostor from submitting a cancellation for your account. 

Can you inform why are you canceling your service with us? . 

Thanks for your cooperation.
```

## Reasons why they should follow procedures

```
It is very important to follow the cancellation procedure. This way we can guarantee the safety of a client's site and the speed of the process by 
preventing an impostor from submitting a cancellation for your account. 
By following procedures we can guarantee:


1- Authentication. Control Panel submissions lets us know the request came from the authorized person of the account, as only that person should have 
   access to that system.
2- Automation. Control Panel submissions are entered in the system's queue for cancellation. This expedites the process and reduces time needed to 
   processing it. 
3- Convenience. We don't have to tell customers 365 days a year the info they have to submit for cancellation as all information is there. 
   Additionally, clients do not have to wait for e-mail replies to process their cancellations, which may delay the process and cause confusion due 
   to emails sometimes getting lost in transit.
4- Security. See no. 1 


Thanks for your cooperation.
```

## Customer insist in not following procedures

```
We understand your discomfort with the whole situation.  However, I invite you to look at it from our point of view for a second.  We are quite 
strict about security here, and we do not allow changes unless we can be absolutely sure the request came from the actual owner of the account. I 
apologize if we seem inflexible because of that, but it is necessary.


Do you expect our clients to feel reassured about the security of their accounts if we were lax in our overseeing of them?


Thanks for your cooperation.
```

## Cancellation procedure : Domain Taken

```
Using the username/password combo that appears in your "Welcome" letter, go to the client portal from serverpointapps.com, then to "Menu -> Accounting ->cancel" and please fill out the form that will be provided. 


Next, select a new domain name, this time make sure it's not taken by using the domain search utility at the top of our main page.  Once you're 
certain the domain is available, go through the order process again, following the same steps. This time, however, when you get to the part where you 
must press a button to charge your card, *don't* do it... close the browser.  Since the charge went through when you first made the order, this will 
avoid getting charged again. The accounting personnel will look for the new data you entered and use the first charge to create the new account. 
E-mail us once you do this process so that we can activate the new replacing account.


Thanks for your cooperation.
```

## Possible cancellation : Due to bandwidth

```
Do you know that your account has exceeded the amount of bandwidth limited to it? This isn't bad, since it does indicate that your website is quite popular 
The problem is that we pay for every single bit of bandwidth that a customer exceeds.  That's why we establish limit on data transfer per type of account.
You do not wish to have your account canceled and make you go through the work of transferring your precious work else.  We understand how hosting 
companies today and in most cases, and even though they might provide an amazing list of features, they are so overworked that the support is the 
best.
Please contact us and we'll work this out.  I'll check once again on your bandwidth limit, but if it hasn't changed, we still might need for your to 
upgrade to an --------------------.
Thanks for your cooperation.
```

## Possible cancellation : Moving to another host

```
We understand that you might have found another hosting with similar or cheaper prices. What we can suggest is that you try them first before signing 
up.  Most companies provide a lot of features, but not the necessary support for them.
Their interaction with the customer in many times is slow, inaccurate and meaningless. This is because most of them are overworked. Although they 
provide low prices on service, they also provide a low customer service as well.

We, on the other hand, worry about our customer's satisfaction.  We do our best in providing fast and efficient service as we would like to receive.
Remember, features along don't price a hosting plan. There's also the quality of bandwidth, power of servers, customer service response time, the 
expertise of the staff (part time college students or do you prefer expert long-time system administrators?), solidity of the company, and much more.
If you have any questions, just let us know.  If you still decide to continue with the cancellation of your account, we wish you the best.
