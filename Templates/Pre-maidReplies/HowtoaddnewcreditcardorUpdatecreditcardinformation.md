## Error Message D while charging the credit card

**Error Message D**

Hi,

The error message D means that charge is declined by your bank/credit card provider. The possible reasons can be .. 

   - You mistyped the billing address 
   - Your bank have placed a block on your card against online transactions  
   - There is some temporary problem with your bank's gateway 


The best option is to contact your credit card provider and tell them that charge to your credit card is been declined. May be they can find out the problem.
