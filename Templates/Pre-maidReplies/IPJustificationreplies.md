##  IP Justification request

```
Hi,

Because of the number of IPs you have ordered, we'd like to know how you intend to use them. ARIN, American Registry of IP Numbers, the organization in charge of IP numbers in the United States, requires any user with more than 4 IPs to submit an explanation on what will the IPs be used for, list of web sites that will be hosted in them, etc.

We look forward to welcoming you to ServerPoint.
```

## If customer is not providing reasonable justification

```
Hi,

ARIN, the American Registry for Internet Numbers, requires 80% utilization of your IP allocation before we can assign you more IPs. Since these web sites have no content, it does not meet their criteria.

The maximum number of IPs that can be provided without meeting that requirement is 8 IPs. Once you have used six of them, with valid reasons for ARIN as to why each web site needs its own IP, then we can release more.

Be aware that the Internet is running out of IP numbers. Providing IP numbers is now a very strict matter. Hosting and FTP will unfortunately not be a valid reason, as they will reply back to just use a shared IP.

Although we own the IPs, our clients must follow these regulations, or else ARIN will not provide us with more IP allocations in the future.

## non acceptable ip justification

```
Hi,

The list of domain you sent, none of those domains have website. Since these web sites have no content, it does not meet the criteria of ARIN, the American Registry for Internet Numbers.

The maximum number of IPs that can be provided without meeting that requirement is 2 IPs. Once you have proper websites running on those domains, with valid reasons for ARIN as to why each web site needs its own IP, then we can release more.

Be aware that the Internet is running out of IP numbers. Providing IP numbers is now a very strict matter. Hosting and FTP will unfortunately not be a valid reason, as they will reply back to just use a shared IP.

Although we own the IPs, our clients must follow these regulations, or else ARIN will not provide us with more IP allocations in the future.

Please let me know how would you like to proceed.
