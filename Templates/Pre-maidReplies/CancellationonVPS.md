## Default Cancellation Message

```
Hello,
We are sorry to hear that you are leaving.
May we ask why you are canceling the server? Was our service unsatisfactory? Is there anything we can do to help? 
Has there been any problems, issues or dissatisfaction?
We'd like to keep you as a client or have the opportunity to help you with any online needs you may have in the future.

Please respond back to this message to confirm the sender of the cancellation request.

Please also go ahead and delete your virtual machine. Colossuscloud VM can be Cancelled/Destroyed from client portal.

Login to client portal from https://portal.serverpoint.com/cgi-bin/gen4cp/engine/login.cgi
Click "Manage your Vms"
Click "Settings of the VM" you need
Click "Actions" and click "Destroy VM"
Enter the client portal password in the field and click "Destroy"


The VM and its snapshots, will be deleted. If you need to restore the VM back, you may do so within the next few hours under 'VMs Pending to Destroy'.

For security, and legal reasons, I can not destroy your data.  

Let us know once you deleted VM.
```
