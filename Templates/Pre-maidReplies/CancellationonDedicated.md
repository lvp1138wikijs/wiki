**Why 7 days cancellation policy**?

A server is an expensive piece of hard ware and we always need to maintain the inventory of servers to provide the servers to our clients immediately therefore we always keep the inventory high. We need 7 prior notice to keep the inventory and to decide how many new servers we need to order to complete our required inventory.

 Hi,
 
You can do a cancellation request from the client portal.

login to the client portal from https://portal.serverpoint.com You can cancel the server through there. Just click on the settings of the server, then click the Actions tab, and you will see the option to cancel it. 


According to the dedicated server contract, you have to submit cancellation 7 days before your payment date. If you are late on cancellation, the system will charge you prorated invoice remaining days.


May we ask why you are canceling the server? Was our service unsatisfactory? Is there anything we can do to help? 
Has there been any problems, issues or dissatisfaction?


We'd like to keep you as a client or have the opportunity to help you with any online needs you may have in the future.

Hi,

We recently received a cancellation from you for one of your dedicated servers. We are sorry to hear that you are leaving.

May we ask why you are canceling the server? Was our service unsatisfactory? Is there anything we can do to help? Perhaps a new pricing arrangement?

We'd like to keep you as a client or have the opportunity to help you with any online needs you may have in the future.

Regards,

**Reply : Cancellation on Co-location Server**

Hi, 
You have a colocation server with us.

Please reply this email with the confirmation that you want to cancel your account.


Also download Shipping instructions authorization form from below link and send it back to us so that we can ship your server back to you.

Please send us confirmation as soon as you send us the form so I can check with Accounting regarding that.
