## Initial Reply if a reactivation request received

```
Hi,
 
We are checking your server details and you will get an update shortly.
```

## Reply if server available to restore

***Note: Calculate the exact amount and then replace $xx.xx with that amount***

```
Hi,
 
Your server is available restore. But you have to pay $xx.xx to clear the due invoices until today and also need to pay server reactivation fee $25. Please confirm that, so that we can continue with your account restoration request.
```
