**If reseller asking about special discounts for ordering new servers**


```
Hi,
 
Thanks for contacting us regarding our dedicated server reseller program. I'm
sure you will be pleased with our quick delivery of servers and service.

As an added note, VPS and Cloud servers will soon be part of this program,
offering you a wider variety of quality affordable services to offer to your
clients.

Since you are already in the server reselling industry, all we ask is to see a
bill from one of the companies that you currently resell for in order for us to
apply an advanced discount to your account. The higher the volume, the higher
the advance discount will be.

This discount would be applied to your account after you have placed your first
order. 

Whenever you are ready to do this, please, do not hesitate in informing me by
replying back to this ticket. If you are planning on ordering your first server
soon, then by all means, please provide us with a copy of a recent invoice
along with the order ID for your first order.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Have a great day,
```
