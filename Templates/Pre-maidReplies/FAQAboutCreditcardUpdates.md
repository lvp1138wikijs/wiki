## 1: Why its necessary to add details of credit card when add/update credit card ?


```
Hi,
 
The reason why there is a need to re-enter all credit card information is because this data is encrypted, as a whole, for security reasons
and to comply with a variety of legal protocols.

Once it is encrypted, not even we have access to see a client's credit card. Because all of the information is encrypted as a whole, we can't
just update some part of it.

As for bank information, the actual credit card holder is the only person that usually knows that kind of information. Unfortunately, we
are the victims of a lot of credit card fraud by people using stolen credit card numbers. Such people just have numbers, addresses, etc,
but do not know which is the bank provider. Thus, it helps us identify fraud.

I hope that helps you understand why it is designed like this. We thoroughly think every aspect of our control panel to facilitate
features, and to protect our clients.

## 2: Why do you required Bank and Bank Phone number fields when adding funds or submitting a card ?

```
Hi,

This requirement is needed now to combat the high rise of fraud on the Internet. 
When frauders steal credit card numbers, they don't know which bank or credit card provider manages that number. They just have access to numbers. 
This is how we know who are real card holders and who are not.

Our accounting department does verify all submitted credit cards, specially those of new clients, by calling your card provider/bank and making sure that number belongs to that bank.
