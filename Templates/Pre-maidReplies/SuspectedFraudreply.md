## Request Authorization form from suspicious shared hosting account orders

```
There was a problem during the order process of -----------. 
Even though charge went through, our bank flagged the transaction
as a possible credit card fraud.

To proceed with the creation of the account, the bank requires that
an authorization form be filled out.

Please fill out the form and e-mail it back to us ASAP.  

You may download the form from the following link:

http://www.serverpoint.com/forms/en/authorization_form.pdf

We need BOTH your CC and personal ID. If we do not receive the 
authorization form, we will have to void the transaction.
	
If you were to send the form through fax, our number is 702-442-1962.  Please
set the scan resolution to the photo setting.  This will improve the clarity
and legibility of the characters and graphics on the faxed document.

Our recommendation when faxing would be making a copy of the form
along with the IDs to make sure it is clear and understandable.  If it
looks clear enough, fax us the copy instead.  This will result in receiving
a clear form, rather than a dark and illegible one which is the common
way faxes are received.  Once the fax has been sent, send us an email so our 
staff may be aware of it.

Sorry for the inconvenience this may cause you.  
		
If you have any question, let us know.
	
Regards,
Serverpoint Inc.
