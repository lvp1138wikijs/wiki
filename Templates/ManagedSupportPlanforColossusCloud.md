# Q: Will that be proactive support, which means you will monitor and check my server for any problem?

```
Please be aware, that will not be "Proactive" support, rather you will have to contact us in case of any problem you will be facing and our staff will check your problem on priority basis.

We will monitor uptime of your Virtual Machines, for this you will have to open a ticket with us along with the IP address of your VM and list of ports for which you would like us to setup monitoring, and request to setup monitoring to your Virtual machine.

In case your VM will go down, or stop responding to those ports, our monitoring server will send alert to you as well as to our Support team, and they will check your VM for any problem at our end. However if they will find VM is up and running at our end, however monitoring server is still not able to ping your server, then they will send you an email asking you about it and will check server further upon your reply and request.
