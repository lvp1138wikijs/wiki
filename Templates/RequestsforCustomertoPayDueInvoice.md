**Payment Failed: Credit Card Declined Error**

```
Hi,
I am with ServerPoint.com and I am one of your assigned agents. I'd like to inform you that at this moment in time one of your invoices is past due beyond our usual allowed period.

For some reason your credit card is currently being declined. Unfortunately, we don't know why as our credit card processor, FirstData, does not indicate the reason, mostly for privacy reasons. 

We have automatically attempted the charge three times over a six day period, as allowed by our agreements with Visa/MC/AMEX and Discover.
Most of the time, the reason is that your credit card has expired, or, your credit card provider has blocked us from charging your card.

Please call your bank to clear this issue and let us know on this ticket if we can attempt it again. Or, if you wish to provide a new card, please follow this procedure:

- Login with your ServerPoint.com username and password
- On the top click "Add funds"
-You can "Pay with a credit or debit card" or "Pay with Paypal"

If you are having any problems with payment, please let us know. We may be able to work an arrangement with you. We'd like to keep you as a customer and of course, help your business grow.

If you do not wish to keep this server, please let us know instead of letting it expire. We'd appreciate any feedback that you can provide us.
We hope to hear from you soon. Have a great day!

Regards,
```
