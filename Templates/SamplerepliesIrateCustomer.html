<p>Each issue is different, no client is same.&nbsp;It's just for reference.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>&gt;&nbsp;Speed/Computational power for shared hosting</strong></h2>
<h4>Question : That still doesnâ€™t answer my question. Will it be faster for the end user to get my webpage on their computer, and by how much (eg. 200% faster, 400% faster, stc.)?</h4>
<h4>Reply :&nbsp;</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>My name is Peter and I am the lead network engineer at&nbsp;<a href="http://serverpoint.com/">ServerPoint.com</a>.</p>
<p>The answer to you question is no. The reason for that is that&nbsp;<a href="http://serverpoint.com/">ServerPoint.com</a>&nbsp;does not throttle the transfer rate of your web site. It will send the website out to the client at the highest transfer rate that the recipient, and the path between us and the recipient, can handle.</p>
<p>Speed is actually not a term used on the Internet, because speed is just simply the speed of electrons going through a copper cable or photons going through fiber, and that is is always a constant speed.</p>
<p>The proper term to be used is actually capacity. How many bits per second can fit through the pipe. How many CPU cores are available, etc.</p>
<p>The difference between plans is resource capacity. Capacity of how much CPU is assigned to your account, how much RAM is assigned to each PHP process, and so on.</p>
<p>If your website hits those established capacities, then you will notice the transfer rate slowed down, because, for example, a PHP hit on your web site may need an entire CPU core for three second to process a purchase, but your hosting plan may only be assigned half a CPU core. That is just an example.</p>
<p>If a PHP hit on your ecommerce app requires half a CPU core, but you get ten hits at a time, and only one CPU core can be used by your plan, then you will hit a CPU limit, and thus, the PHP script won't be able to process the hit quick enough.</p>
<p>The other major difference is that the servers we used for the "cloud" hosting plan are actually more powerful machines. CPUs with higher clock speeds and more computational power, disk I/O that can handle more megabytes per second, and so on.</p>
<p>So, as long as your website does not hit such resource limits, you are good either in a Premium or Cloud plan. If it hits any of those limits, then you will notice the server won't process your applications as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>What are the limits you may ask. That is internal knowledge and proprietary, and those limits are mostly there to prevent abuse. For example, we don't want one single client's application taking over all of the CPU cores in a server, as that would essentially shut down the websites for every other client on the same server.</p>
<p>I hope that explanation helps.</p>
<p>Peter :)</p>

<h2><strong>&gt;&nbsp;Technical Issue</strong></h2>
<h4><br><strong>Question : I would like to express my deep disappointment in the gross negligence of the technician that inadvertently deleted our</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://shoppersrule.com/">shoppersrule.com</a>&nbsp;domain while attempting to create a clone development site. At the same time I would like to express my gratitude for the efforts taken to rectify the situation.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey Jim,</p>
<p>This is Peter. Don't worry. We will make sure all works fine. It's not an easy task and it isn't a simple request, specially when it involves Plesk and Miva, since we don't support either of them anymore. Plesk because it is a pain to work with (while cPanel is so well designed), and Miva, because at this point in time is a dead technology.</p>
<p>We make the best effort though to help in such cases.</p>
<p>The Plesk issue, we've actually seen a report of that before, where Plesk would delete the website in certain instances of manipulating subdomains. I'll find the report on that to verify. It may be an old bug. Or again, one of us could have click the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But we will make it happen. Also, I suggest you run this website on several servers. Since this is generating such revenue for you, you shouldn't risk running it on just one machine. Having multiple servers running will help eliminate these issues, as other servers can take over when something happens to one.</p>
<p>Once we figure this out properly, that would be the next step to follow. To clone it for production, not just for development.</p>
<p>I'll be supervising the case.</p>
<p>Peter :)</p>

<h2>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Unsatisfied with GUI</strong></h2>
<h4>Question :&nbsp;I really do not like your entire UI, have you ever tried it yourself, as a customer?&nbsp;Are there any plans to make all of this more user friendly?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reply :&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hello Mike!<br><br>Hope you are doing well today!<br><br>I have been going through your previous tickets, and I can see that the first few weeks after your transition to us has been demanding for you. Especially in this one I understand that you have couple of concerns regarding our GUI.&nbsp;<br>First of all I really want to thank you for your genuine cooperation, because you have been in constant touch with us trying to figure out the issues and giving us positive feedbacks. Rather than opting out at the first hindrance, you are really trying to make this work out. We really appreciate it!<br><br>Now coming to GUI, this new client portal Version 4.0 was released on April 2nd, 2014. It was a major upgrade from our old portal both in look and in features.&nbsp;<br>From there, we had 5 more major/minor releases, in fact 3 in this year itself. And we are currently at Version 4.1.5 released just few weeks back, September 1st, 2016.<br>This is not our final product. In reality, no product/software can be 'final'.<br>All softwares and control panels needs constant up-gradation, incorporating new features while making it more user friendly.&nbsp;<br>Looking at the frequency of our releases I hope you understand that our designers too are seriously engaged in this task.&nbsp;<br>You can see all these details from your ClientPortal, in the home page click on the Changelog hyperlink . (Also see the screenshot attached)&nbsp;<br><br>And at the moment their priority is to add more features and make all of it under 1 portal. As far as I understand, they will start working on making it more user friendly once some major features are added. And for that we need inputs from customers like you.&nbsp;<br><br>So going back to 2 questions that you asked initially :<br><br>&gt;&gt; Have you ever tried it yourself, as a customer?<br>Yes, but the thing is we have got too used to our portal and chances are we might overlook some of these aspects. We need new eyes to see something that we don't. And we know that. That is the reason why we contact all customers after they sign up, asking for their feedback as they uses it more. Also at the bottom end of the panel, you can see an option where you can send your ideas : "Do you have ideas on how to improve this panel? Did you find a bug? Please let us know here."&nbsp;<br>Even though we encourage all to send us feedback/idea, the fact is out of 100 customers that sign up, only 1 or 2 like yourself will give us any positive feedbacks.&nbsp;<br><br>&gt;&gt; Are there any plans to make all of this more user friendly?<br>Definitely. Infact it is already being done as explained above.<br><br>All our panels, including domain management, billing and virtualization techniques are handled by our in-house developers. And they are always trying to better our products. But to do that we need cooperation from customers like you.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have some time to spare, kindly let us know what all things you think that needs improvement in our panel. You can either use the Feedback feature in portal or even better just reply to this mail :)<br><br>We will forward it our lead developer and add it to our to-do list.<br><br>[Ref: &nbsp; TICKET ID&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.serverpoint.com/tickets/staff/index.php?/Tickets/Ticket/View/405991/inbox/-1/-1/-1/0">JMD-172-90106</a>&nbsp;]</p>

<h2>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Bandwidth Limit</strong></h2>
<h4>Question :&nbsp;There is no such thing as unlimited bandwidth. Lacking a crystal ball, I cannot&nbsp;risk hosting with you to find it out the hard way. So what happens is<br>either I get a warning or you throw me offline, or throttle. If you'd&nbsp;just told me when that happens, we'd be in business. I'm none the&nbsp;wiser, but do get a little irritated as you apparently think I'm a&nbsp;fool.</h4>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reply :&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. Yes, you are right. There can be no unlimited bandwidth usage without any restrictions.&nbsp;<br>Only thing we are concerned is that traffic to your site should not affect other customers sharing your same hardware resources, (assuming you are looking for our Shared Cloud Hosting). So now the problem is not about bandwidth limit but rather the bandwidth usage at a given time.</p>
<p>We will usually ignore temporary spikes in bandwidth usages. However, if we see a unusual usage for a prolonged amount of time, we will take up some precautionary measures, as every other host would do. We will temporarily limit your bandwidth allocation and inform you regarding the same if we suspect the traffic to your site is not genuine, but as a result of maybe a DDoS attack or if it is bot generated. We will only go forward with throttling in very rare cases, like if we suspect a DDoS attack but otherwise no. Rest assured, we will not terminate or cancel your account immediately in the first sight of a spike.</p>
<p>And as my colleague mentioned earlier 500GB/month is perfectly okay with us :)</p>
