# Reactivation replies for shared

**Reply if the Account is exist in the server**

```
Hello,

Thank you for your payment. Right now we are working in the reactivation procedure of your account. The account will be reactivated soon. We will contact you again once the account is reactivated in the server. 
 
```
**Reply if the Account not exist in the server**

```
Hello,

Your account has been cancelled and all your data/emails are gone. You will have to start over again if you want the service. Please place order from website if you want to proceed.

Let us know if you have any further questions.
Regards,
```

**Reply2: If the customer ask about account restore**

```
Hi,

We can't restore the data for your account. The account was completely deleted from the server. We don't keep cancelled account backup more than 5 days . 

If you place a new order for this domain, then we can setup this account again in our server. But its entirely a fresh account. If you have the backup of your files, then you can restore it in to the new account.

Let us know if you have any further questions.
```

**Convert Resold account to Main Account**

```
Hi,

You domain is suspended due to non payment. This is a resold account and the main account of this was cancelled due to non payment.

But we can move your account from resold to main account under our new web hosting plan http://www.serverpoint.com/en/plans.phtml .

Select a webhosting plan and provide us following details

Your Full name

Address [ street name, City, Country, Zip code]
Phone number 
Email address 

Also provide us the credit card authorization form , you can download it from 

https://secure.serverpoint.com/english/forms/authorization_form_custom.pdf

If you select Basic hosting plan , then put $9.95 in that form . 

Thank you
```
