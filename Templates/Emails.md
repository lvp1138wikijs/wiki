Hello ______,  

This is ______ from ServerPoint. I hope you are doing well today. As an email Administrator, you need to fill out this form

https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsesc&ct=eformts

Hotmail will ask for certain information, like your domain name, type of emails you sent and sample emails etc.

Once they are satisfied with the information provided they will white list your IPs. In case, they need IP provided (ServerPoint) to provide authorization that you have full control over _IPADDRESS_. Then please let us know we will gladly do that.

Contact us if you face any problem.
```
