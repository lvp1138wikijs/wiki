Hi,
You can see your due invoice from Client Portal » Menu » Accounting and you can pay it from there.
Here the procedure,

1. Go to https://www.serverpointapps.com/ and click on >> Client Portal.
2. Once login, click on Menu » Billing.
3. Then you can see the due invoice under >> Your due invoices.
4. Click on 'Pay' button to charge payment.
The payment will be charged from the registered credit card or from the available credit.
```

**Credit Charge Fail**


```
If there are problems charging your credit card, we continue charging for a few days after the due date.

Sometimes the server at the bank may be so congested with traffic that it does not allow the charge to go through. Only very rarely we get declined 
because a client's CC has no more credit left.

Check with your bank to learn why they declined the charge.  We will keep trying for the next few days.

What we do recommend to add account funds  to your account by logging to your Client Portal. Once the payment added, then please let us know.

Si hay problemas cargando su tarjeta, el sistema automatico de cargos continuara intentando hacer cargos.  Durante todo ese período, el sistema envía 
al e-mail primario de contacto de la cuenta los avisos de que el cobro falló.

Contacte a su banco para saber por que rechazaron los cargos.  Seguiremos intentando cargar su tarjeta temporeramente.

Por ahora le recomendamos anada creditos manualmente en su panel de control  y con dichos creditos pague 
manualmente por meses de servicio en su cuenta. De esta forma evitara cualquier interrupcion al servicio de su cuenta
