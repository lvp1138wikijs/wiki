# Zone Management Servers
We need few servers to manage every zone. Wec call them as Zone Management Servers. 

We use an eight node microcloud server to build the management servers. 

-    [Management Server 1](/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/ZoneManagementServers/ManagementServers1)
-    [Management Server 2](/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/ZoneManagementServers/ManagementServers2)
-    [Management Server 3](/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/ZoneManagementServers/ManagementServers3)
-    [Management Server 4](/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/ZoneManagementServers/ManagementServers4)
-    [Management Servers 5](/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/ZoneManagementServers/ManagementServers5)
