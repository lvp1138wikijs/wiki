<h1>Bridge Server -2 &amp; OOB</h1>
<p>The management server-7 is the Secondary Bridge/Gateway server. We also install the KVM hypervisor in it and created a windows VM for console access. It's called the console server. The server has connections to the ipmi switch. That helps us to connect the servers via ipmi.</p>
<p>First, we have to set the server as a bridge. You can check this, <a href="https://216.108.237.96:3443/en/home/l3admin/InfrastructureSetup/BridgeServer">Instruction to Setup Bridges</a></p>
<p>Then install the KVM hypervisor. Follow this page, How to Install KVM hypervisor.&nbsp;</p>
