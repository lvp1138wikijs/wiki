# Accounting Procedure


**Important accounting information and procedures**

- Please be aware that you have signed up for a recurring service. This means you will be automatically billed for your service once the initial term is up.

If you do not wish to renew your service automatically, please open a ticket with the accounting department and inform our accounting staff.

- You will receive a bill, via email, every time your service comes up for renewal. Please be aware that sometimes, on very rare occasions, you may not receive that email (and this goes for any kind of email). Perhaps your email provider all of a sudden considers it spam and deletes it, or, it may get lost for some other reason.
- All accounting issues must be handled via our ticket system and not over the phone or live chat. Simple questions, that do not require looking up your accounting information, may be handled via our chat system. This is to protect your privacy.
- ServerPoint.com will automatically charge your credit card (if that is your method of payment) for the next service term. This charge will be attempted several times over several days if for some reason the charge is being declined.
- If paying with Paypal, then please login to the control panel . In the top select "Add funds". From there you can select the payment method.
- If paying with check or money order, please make sure your check arrives in time.
- If, after an appropriate number of days have passed beyond your payment due date, we still have not received payment or have not heard from you, your service will be suspended.

“Appropriate” number of days varies as we have several rules to follow. For example, we may not suspend a server on a Friday or weekend, as we understand you may be out on vacation enjoying your free time. Thus, the number of days is never a specific number but is 7 days on average.

- No cancellations will be done over the phone. All cancellation requests must be done via our ticket system. Our staff will of course verify your identity before taking any action.
