### Reactivation Procedure on Dedicated Server

> Exception
> 
> Some times customer want us to reactivate server and ask for grace period. We make exceptions for old and good customers. In case customer has problem with his credit card which is being resolved with his bank, and will take few days. Then we can reactivate his server. But this has to be approved from Ms Minerva. In case of reactivation, Make sure to schedule on calender to check either account is paid or not after agreed amount of time/days. If customer still do not pay after agreed amount of time, then suspend it and keep Ms Minerva informed.

> **Never reactivate a suspended server without the permission of Mr. Peter or Ms. Minerva**.
