If a customer requested to add additional features like more IPs, Add support plans, additional Disk drives, ram ,etc . The do the following steps

Then inform him about the additional charges and calculate charges for remaining days and inform client about the payment

For additional RAM:

- Inform cx about the RAM prices.
- Check with DC whether the server supports additional RAM
- If cx confirms the pricing check with DC and add additional RAM to server. 
- If server already has maximum RAM, then inform him he consider about new server which support more RAM. If not, then provide him price for upgrade.

- For additional disk, provide customer about the price details, check it from additional charges. If customer ready and ask them root/administrator password and check how many disk they currently have. If they have 2 disk drive, then they have to purchase bigger case. If has only one disk drive, then ask then when we can schedule this.

  -  Be sure you inform the customer to [add payment](/Templates/HowtoaddpaymentusingCreditCard/HowtoAddAdditionalFeatures) and then charge it using One time billing.
  -  Once disk/Ram added then follow this procedure.
