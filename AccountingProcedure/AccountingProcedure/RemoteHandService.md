# Procedure for Remote Hand Service

> RHS Procedure
> 
> Due to issues handling and charging for special work we are going to establish new procedures that must be follow at all times.
> Every time hand remote service is requested, you must:
> 
> 1. Inform the customer we will bill him either by 15 minutes interval or by hour which should be paid in full in less than 24 hours. Be sure he agrees before anyone do anything on the server.
> 
> 2. If the service provided to the customer reached 1 hour, STOP and send Minerva and message informing her about the work you are doing and that you already spent an hour on it (be sure you consider time of everybody involve not just your time). She will have to authorize you to continue after customer agree to pay for another hour.
> 
> 3. If work is not finished after the fist two hours, be sure you contact Minerva again to ask for authorization to continue working.
> 
> It is imperative the customer is always aware on how much time the job has consumed and how much is the bill so far. That way he won't have any excuse. Also be sure you always remind then that invoices must be paid in 24 hours.
> 
> Also, be sure customer is actually billed for the amount it took us including from the moment you got the request and you started working. I noticed so many times you guys are charging for 15 minutes when the process actually took more than that and more people were involve in the issue.
