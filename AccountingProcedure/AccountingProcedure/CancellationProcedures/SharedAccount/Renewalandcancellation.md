## Renewals

**ETERNAL ACCOUNTS CAN BE RENEWED FOR ONE YEAR ONLY**.

We cannot renew OLD SHARED hosting plans like A+Basic or A+Eternal for more than one year. The client portal will not do automatic renewal for more than one year and the NPD will get updated for just 1 year only even if you try to renew for more years.

These are too old plans and the price is too cheap when comparing to current one. So always tell customer to upgrade to new hosting plans if they need renewal for more than one year. 

**Cancellation**

**ACCOUNT MUST BE CANCELLED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF NON PAYMENT**

If an account with old hosting plans (A+Basic or A+Eternal) are due, **we should not give more than two weeks for cancellation** after non payment.
