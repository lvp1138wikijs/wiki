When we find some suspicious behavior in new order (but it is not enough to ask for AF), we can activate the account and add the account to our Fraud monitoring sheet in gmail. Its link is as given below:

Once we find that this particular user is a fraud (this can be identified by monitoring various activities of this user like: CC transactions, number of servers created, abuse complaints for this accounts IP address etc), please do the following:

- Suspend the account and contact customer and ask for AF using the template in the link: Suspected Fraud reply
- Disable Credit card
- Wait for 15 days before cancelling the account. Contact this user atleast 3 times during this time period to see if he replies back with AF details (the reason is that when we cancel, all the client information is gone, there is no way to bring that information back. If we don't give those 2 weeks the user can take us to the court.)
- If customer replies with AF, authorize it and activate account
- If no reply even after multiple followups for 15 days, cancel account. Also note that we cannot do any refund for the CC transactions in this case.
