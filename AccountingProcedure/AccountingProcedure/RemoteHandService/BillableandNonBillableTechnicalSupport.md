# Billable and Non Billable (Free) Technical Support


**Guidelines**

**Categories for tickets**

Tickets should be easy to categorize under several major categories, to help better determine whether it is a billable ticket or not. This is not for you to do changes to a ticket to categorize it, but, just as your own mental guideline to know under which category a tickets falls in, and whether that category is RHS or not.

For now, please provide feedback on the categories, any that are missing, etc.

Categories in **RED** color should be Billable, and in **BLACK** are the categories that comes under Non Billable Support.

**Categories for a support ticket**:

1. **Initial diagnostic of a server that is slow or down (not due to an accounting issue)**


1. **Network diagnostic and server access**
   -  Packet loss, slow access, etc.
   - Customer made a change that shut down his/her access, i.e.:    accidentally disabled NIC or made mistake with firewall
 
1. **Consulting**

   - How to do something at the OS level, or business operation level
   - How to do something in Plesk or cPanel

1. **Service continuity**

-    Moving a service/web site from one server to another, not caused by failure
-    Assistance with data recovery or site transfer because of hardware failure 
-    Assistance with data recovery or site transfer, either from accidental loss by client, or, because of hardware failure
 
5. **Troubleshooting**

   -  Do not charge for simple works, i.e a work which do not take more than 2-3 minutes. like restart applications, Adding users, quick changes in firewall, etc 
   -  A service requires restart because it went down, using Plesk or cPanel
   -  Troubleshooting a problem happening to an installation of Plesk or cPanel
   -  Problems caused by hardware failure
   - Operating system changes by customer, such as replacing kernel, causes a problem.
   - An issue related to a service, such as with IIS/Apache, a service needs restart, or client trying to configure something and not getting expected result
 
1. **Installation of software**

   -  Operating system packages
   -  Software that requires compilation, and/or forces compilation of system packages (i.e. Apache because of a new compiled PHP)
   -  Installation of Popular Free Content management, Blogging (Such as Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, PhpBB), E-commerce and Business applications
   -  Re-Installation of operating system due to failure, incompatibility
   -  Re-installation of OS due to customer fault or by request
   

1.  **Security**

    -  A compromised server
 
8. **DNS**

   -  Customer is trying to point a domain to use in his/her server, and is unable to do so
   -  Issues related to the actual DNS service installed in the server
 
9. **Email**

   -  Troubleshooting a slow email server, queue is loaded, etc
   -  Email delivery issues, due to simple guidelines such as reverse DNS, incorrect HELO
   -  Email delivery issues due to IP been blacklisted, compromised server sending spam, etc.
   

**When to bill for support**

1. Anytime you need to login to a client's server to perform any of the red labeled duties above
1. If a client's ticket goes very long (say, more than 10 tickets), it is possible that ticket is becoming managed support or consulting.
1. If the client did something that caused a problem, that is certainly billable support
1. Anything that forces one of our techs to go to the data center between 6PM and 8AM PST or on a weekend, and the issue is not caused by hardware problem, is billable.

**Level 1/2/3 and discount considerations**

1. In a case where an issue is so easy for you to solve and takes you only a few minutes, it is up to your consideration whether to bill the client or not. If it was so simple, but you feel it should be billable, you could bill the client 5 minutes of support and even give him/her 50% discount, to make it low cost.
1. Of course, if the client is opening an unusually high number of tickets and you feel those add up to quite a long time, you might want to inform the client that future tickets may be billable.
1. Perhaps working on an issue took you a long time, but it was because you did not have the experience to fix it and you needed to research it for the purpose of fixing the issue. You should not bill a client for the time it took you to learn. The exception to this is if the client specifically asked to do research or the problem the client is submitting is of a highly complicated nature.
1. Sometimes, you may give a client a discount, perhaps because it is an old client, or the client says that he/she can't afford it, etc. It is at your discretion to offer a discount from time to time.

**Quota**

From what I can see, during a high volume day, there might be at least 10 to 15 billable tickets. From simpler ones that may only be billed for 5 or 10 minutes, to complex ones. Being able to now easily charge for support will allow us to expand our support team, acquire better tools and also increase salaries and/or provide bonuses.

**Empty time**

Let's say a ticket took two hours to work on, but out of those two hours, you didn't do anything during one hour because, say, you were waiting for the client's server to do something.

You should not bill the client for an hour that you are not actively working on the server.

In a case like that, bill for two hours, but provide a 50% discount.
