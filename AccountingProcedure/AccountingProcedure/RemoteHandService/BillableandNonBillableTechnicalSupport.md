# Billable and Non Billable (Free) Technical Support


**Guidelines**

**Categories for tickets**

Tickets should be easy to categorize under several major categories, to help better determine whether it is a billable ticket or not. This is not for you to do changes to a ticket to categorize it, but, just as your own mental guideline to know under which category a tickets falls in, and whether that category is RHS or not.

For now, please provide feedback on the categories, any that are missing, etc.

Categories in **RED** color should be Billable, and in **BLACK** are the categories that comes under Non Billable Support.
