> **CANCELLATION AFTER SUSPENSION**
> 
> - We suspend a suspicious server and keep suspended for at least 15 days and even the entire month if we dont need to rent that server right away.
> - With VPS we can keep suspended for an entire month before cancelling. That is to protect us in case it a real account and they have data on it.

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> It is important then when you suspend a server due to policy violation issue, then send a note to all the staff so that they are aware of suspension. In case customer contact using different email address then staff on duty do not waste time in finding that why server is not responding.
