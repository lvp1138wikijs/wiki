**What is charge Back**

A chargeback occurs when the authorizing bank, that is the cardholder’s bank, the one that originally authorized the charge in the first place, decides that it was wrong and asks for the money back. They don’t actually ask. They actually reach into the bank account and take the money back.

**Types of Charge back**

There are 3 types of charge back

1. **Those that are fraud**: When a chargeback due to fraud occurs, cancel the account completely. Do NOT wait for to run the cancellation process. We don't want to run the risk of that frauder getting access to the account again.
1. **Charge back  which customer puts by mistake**: When a chargeback is not due to fraud, inform the client. If in 24 hours there is no reply, suspend it. The account will canceled when system run the cancellation process. It is good idea to schedule this on the kayako calendar for you not to forget to follow up in case customer indeed contacted back.
1. **PayPal Dispute**: PayPal Dispute is a chargeback from paypal . Check the tutorial from paypal

> **Domain Registration Charges**
> 
>  If there's a Domain Registration associated with the ChargeBack, contact Minerva immediately for the Domain Cancellation and Refund (for ServerPoint). A refund may be issued for new gTLD domain registrations only if the domain is deleted within 4 days of registration.

**Charge back received from account actively new Account**

- If a chargeback is received for an account that is relatively new, or a credit card holder calls saying they did not place that charge, then it is fraud. Just cancel it immediately. Don't suspend. Confirm with Ms. Minerva before cancel account

- If its a shared account, then confirm if their account still active and the domain pointing to us and how old they are, when they contacted us last time and check when the domain name expire.
    - if the domain still pointing to our server, then forward all details to Ms. Minerva to take decision about this.
    - If they are not pointing to us, then that mean they do not need that account. Inform Minerva about that and then cancel account
    
**Next step after you cancel/suspend an account because of charge back**

The next step after you cancel/suspend an account due to charge back, is to send an email to the client.
