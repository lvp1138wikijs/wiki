Hello once again,

As we continue introducing you to our family, we want to make sure that you are aware of what our responsibilities are and what kind of issues we can help you with.

ServerPoint.com's technical expertise is of the highest in the industry. We can do security, programming, research, troubleshooting, and more.

You have signed up for a server with no managed support plan and no control panel. What this means is that you are about to enter the world of server administration. Most likely you are an experienced administrator or have someone that will do this for you.

**Our responsibilities are**:

- To provide you with a server operating system (Windows or Linux) running on hardware that is free of defects. If such hardware fails, it is our responsibility to replace the hardware.
- To provide your server with connectivity to the Internet. Be aware that in this case, our responsibility ends at the switch your server is connected to. If you, for example, misconfigure your server's network interface cutting off its access, that of course, does not indicate we are not providing you with network connectivity.
- Note: the Internet is dynamic, vulnerable, fragile and not perfect. Sometimes, routes on the Internet and other networks/servers may stop working and you may not be able to reach such places. This is of course outside of our control. We are sure you already know that sometimes you just can't reach a web site in another network.
- To provide you with a server based operating system to which you can initially login to at the administrator level (Administrator for Windows, root for Linux). With such a level, you can do whatever you want to the operating system. Be aware though that we are not responsible for what you do to the operating system once you login.
- We, of course, did not design the operating system nor do we manufacture the server's hardware. Thus, we can't guarantee they are free of defects.
- We are in no way responsible for the data on your server. We won't even know about the data that you load into your server as we won't have access to it. Backup! Backup! Backup!


So, basically, what this means is that you are now the administrator of your own server. You can install, remove, configure, setup services, create users, etc, etc, without our intervention.

**Be aware of the following golden rules of server administration**:

- Backup! You could accidentally delete your data, one of your employees could delete it, security issues, your server's hard drive may fail, etc. Backup, backup, backup!
- Your server needs maintenance. Security updates need to be installed, logs need to be rotated, resources (CPU/RAM/Drive) need to be monitored, optimizations need to be done, etc.


If there is anything that you do not know how to do or how to fix, here's what you should do:

- Google it. Google is your best friend. For any problem you may have, someone else has already posted a solution to it online.
- Hire a server administrator. There are many places on the Internet to which you can outsource server administration to. We do not recommend you do this unless you know about the reputation of such companies.
- Contact us. You can hire us for any job you need done. We know our servers well and we can do just about anything you ask us to do. Just open a ticket explaining the issue and we'll help you.


We are here to help you in every way possible to make sure your business' online needs are met. More to follow.
