**Day 1** - Order received. In case the order seems to be doubtful, send AF.

**Day 3** - Make a followup to the AF ticket with the following template:


```
Hello,

We are awaiting your response for the Authorisation form, so that that order can be activated.

Please help us combat the problem of credit card fraud. These procedures are working to make online credit card fraud a thing of the past. 

We kindly request your co-operation here.

We look forward to welcoming you to ServerPoint.

```

**Day 6** - Make a second and final followup to Cx:

```
