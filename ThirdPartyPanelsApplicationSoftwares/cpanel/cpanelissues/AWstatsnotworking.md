# AWstats not working /updating - CPanel

If AWstats is not working /updating in CPanel, please do the following fixes:

- First check permission of /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/awstats.pl, it should be 755.

- Then to update awstats and webalizer run the following script :

```
# /scripts/runweblogs user_name
```

- If that didn't work try fixwebalizer script :

```
# /scripts/fixwebalizer
```

- If that doesnâ€™t update stats, then check domlogs of the domain and see if it is up to date.

```
# /scripts/runstatsonce
```

- If none of the above fixes the issue and the awstats page for the domain is still showing the old date for last update, run the following command :

```
# /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/bin/awstats.pl -config=/home/user_name/tmp/awstats/awstats.domain.com.conf -LogFile=/usr/local/apache/domlogs/domain.com -update
```
**
Note: Replace domain.com with your domain name and replace user_name with your cPanel username.**
