The SSL for backup manager is broken and when Cx contact us regarding this issue inform Cx that R1soft has not released a fix so far for this issue, and a work around is this:

- Go to "about:config"  in firefox from address browser

- search for " security.ssl3.dhe_rsa_aes_128_sha " and " security.ssl3.dhe_rsa_aes_256_sha " 

- Set them both to " false " by right clicking and click on " toggle "

 

Later https://72.18.207.240 will be perfectly accessible.
