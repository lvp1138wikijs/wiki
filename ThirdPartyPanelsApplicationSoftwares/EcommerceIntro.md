# E- commerce Intro

Electronic Commerce â€“ Commonly known as E-commerce

**E-commerce**

It is the trading in products or services using Internet.  Modern e-commerce  typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction's lifecycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.

**Web commerce**

Web commerce is a form of e-commerce that is conducted primarily through the World Wide Web, but may also use email and other aspects of the Internet.

Here are some questions we should be asking of our client before putting together a proposal for the development of an e-commerce website.

**What We Need To Know**

Every online business has different needs, so one solution is unlikely to fit all. Before writing any code or trying an off-the-shelf package, we need to ask the client a few questions:

What are the products/service selling?

How will take payment?

How will items be delivered?

What reporting and other functionalities are required?

**E-commerce hosting**

It is a type of website hosting platform that is used to serve an e-commerce website.

Ecommerce hosting differs from standard Web hosting in that a number of features and functionalities are required to manage and run a commercial website. This includes SSL, database support, shopping cart software, payment processing services, and additional ecommerce software and security initiatives. There are different ecommerce softwares like Magento, Cubecart, osCommerce, Zen cart, etc and ecommerce builder applications like weebly, Bigcommerce, shopyfi, etc

Ecommerce hosting is designed to basically provide entrepreneurs and businesses with all the tools and services required for them to set-up, manage and conduct an ecommerce business. In addition to supplying ecommerce functionality, they will also provide Web space (a Web server) to host your website, an email server or email support, technical support and other standard Web hosting features for businesses.

ServePoint is also offering e-commerce hosting on our shared service. We have introduced a website builder application named weebly. That will help customers to create high-quality website, blog or online store.
