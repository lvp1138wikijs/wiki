# Webmin


Webmin is a web-based system configuration tool for Unix-like systems, although recent versions can also be installed and run on Windows.[4] With it, it is possible to configure operating system internals, such as users, disk quotas, services or configuration files, as well as modify and control open source apps, such as the Apache HTTP Server, PHP or MySQL.[5][6]

Webmin is largely based on Perl, running as its own process and web server. It defaults to TCP port 10000 for communicating, and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with additional required Perl Modules.

It is built around modules, which have an interface to the configuration files and the Webmin server. This makes it easy to add new functionality. Due to Webmin's modular design, it is possible for anyone who is interested to write plugins for desktop configuration.

Webmin also allows for controlling many machines through a single interface, or seamless login on other webmin hosts on the same subnet or LAN
