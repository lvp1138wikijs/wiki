## Installation in CentOS

Latest CentOS release, Exim is no longer available as a standard package. If you want to install Exim to use, or just to try, all you need do is install the EPEL. 

**Install exim using YUM**

```
yum install exim
chkconfig exim on
```
**Now start exim**

```
/etc/init.d/exim start
```

**Set exim to start on boot**

```
/etc/init.d/exim start
chkconfig exim on
```

**Restart exim**

```
/etc/init.d/exim restart
```

**To test, send an email**

```
echo "test" |mail -s "$HOSTNAME" me@example.com
```
Then you can flush the Exim Que and watch the log like this

```
exim -qff ; tail -f /var/log/exim/main.log
```

## Installation in Ubuntu

**Install using apt-get**

```
apt-get install exim4 
```
**Configuration**

```
dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config
```

The user interface will be displayed. The user interface lets you configure many parameters. 

All the parameters you configure in the user interface are stored in /etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf file. If you wish to re-configure the program, either re-run the configuration wizard or manually edit this file using your favourite editor. Run the following command to generate the master configuration file:

```
sudo update-exim4.conf
```

The master configuration file will be generated and stored in /var/lib/exim4/config.autogenerated.

**Start/stop/restart Exim**

```
/etc/init.d/exim4 start
/etc/init.d/exim4 stop
/etc/init.d/exim4 restart
```

**Testing**

```
echo "This is a test." | mail -s Testing someone@somedomain.com
```
