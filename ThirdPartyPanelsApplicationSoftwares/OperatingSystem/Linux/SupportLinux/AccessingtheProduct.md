# Accessing the Product

Linux server can be accessed through SSH service. 

We need SSH client application like Putty, X-shell to access linux servers from a windows installed computer. You can download putty and x-shell from internet and install it on your local machine. They are free. Xshell has more advanced features than putty. 

To access linux servers through putty/Xshell we need the following details

- The server IP address
- SSH Port
- Root or root privileged username 
- The user password

Due to security reason, we do not keep the customer server login details. You can ask customer for that. 

Also we can access the linux colossuscloud VMs through the VNC  viewer application whcih is linked to the customer client portal. Login to the client portal >> Menu >> ColossusCloud manager >> Click on the Console icon of the VM you want to access.
