# hmail:Configuration to use all the IP addresses in the server

*Sample ticket UTC-480-53853*.

If a customer complains of hmail connectivity issues you will have to correct the hmail settings.

This is probably caused because hmail is not configured to work on all the IP addresses in the server.

You will have to correct the hmail settings so that all the IPs in the server can be used by hmail.


```
The hmail program requires  us to use the 0.0.0.0 ip to use all ips in server including localhost
```

You may refer  the following link for more details about the  hmail configuration.
