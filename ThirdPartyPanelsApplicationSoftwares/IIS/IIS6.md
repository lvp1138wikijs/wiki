# IIS 6.0

Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0 with the Microsoft Windows Server 2003 operating system provides integrated, reliable, scalable, secure, and manageable Web server capabilities over an intranet, the Internet, or an extranet.

IIS is a tool for creating a strong communications platform of dynamic network applications.

Organizations of all sizes use IIS to host and manage Web pages on the Internet or on their intranet, to host and manage FTP sites, and to route news or mail using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).

IIS 6.0 leverages the latest Web standards like Microsoft ASP.NET, XML, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) for the development, implementation, and management of Web applications.
