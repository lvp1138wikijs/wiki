<p>Cannot start session without errors, please &nbsp;check errors given in your PHP and/or web server log file and configure your PHP installation properly.</p>
<p>There can be error in writing session files. Either the owner &nbsp;do not have ?write‘ permission or the owner is different.</p>
<p>Normally tmp directories are used to dump sessions. And phpMyAdmin has its own tmp folder. Check the permission and ownership of this folder. Change it to the following</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">Location : /var/cpanel/userhomes/cpanel-phpmyadmin</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">cd /var/cpanel/userhomes/cpanel-phpmyadmin
Permission of tmp must be 700
chmod 700 -R tmp
Ownership must be cpanel-phpmyadmin
chown cpanel-phpmyadmin: -R *</code></pre>
<p>The output should look similar to as given below</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">ll /&nbsp;var/cpanel/userhomes/cpanel-phpmyadmin 
drwx –x –x 4 cpanel-phpmyadmin cpanel-phpmyadmin 4096 Mar 10 23:56 ./
drwx –x –x 5 root root 4096 ../
