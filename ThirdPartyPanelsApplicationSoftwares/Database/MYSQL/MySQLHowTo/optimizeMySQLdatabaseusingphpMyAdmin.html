<p>Log in to your phpMyAdmin and select the database whose tables you wish to optimize through Cpanel or WHM</p>
<p>A list with all the database's tables will appear. Tick the tables you wish to optimize.</p>
<p>From the&nbsp; drop-down menu choose Optimize table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will execute the OPTIMIZE TABLE SQL query on the selected tables and they will be updated and optimized.</p>
