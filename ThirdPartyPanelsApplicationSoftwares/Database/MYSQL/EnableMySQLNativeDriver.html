<p>You can easily enable this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Login to server via&nbsp;SSH &nbsp;as root user and create of edit the following file:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>/var/cpanel/easy/apache/rawopts/all_php5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add the following line to that file: ( If&nbsp;you're using mysqli)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>--with-mysqli=mysqlnd</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If not using mysqli, then use&nbsp;"<i>--with-mysql=mysqlnd</i>" instead.</p>
<p>Save the file, launch <strong>EasyApache</strong> and recompile as normal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done, run a PHP file with phpinfo() as the code to check the extension has been enabled.</p>
