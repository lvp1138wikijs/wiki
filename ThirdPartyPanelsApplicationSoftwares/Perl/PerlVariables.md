# Perl Variables

Perl has 3 types of variables:

Scalar
Array 
Hash

## Array Variables

Array variables are used to represent a list of values.

e.g

```
@profit = (8,13, 2, 100);
```

## Hash Variables

Hashes are represented by the % symbol and they represent key value pairs.

```
%marks = ('Joe' => 68,
         'Sarah' => 75,
         'Sam' => 79,);
```

## Scalar Variable

Scalar variables in Perl are used to represent constant values such as strings and numbers.

Scalar variables are represented by the $ sign.

Scalar variables in perl are case sensitive.

We can use underscores, numbers or upto 255 characters to create scalar variables.

```
e.g: 

$five

$_cat

$_455
```
