Perl has two conditional statements if and unless.

If

The syntax of the if statement is 

```
if(expression)

{

statements;

 }
 ```

Here are a few variations of the if statement

```
if (exp) BLOCK else BLOCK
if (exp) BLOCK elsif (exp) BLOCK ...
if (exp) BLOCK elsif (exp) BLOCK ... else BLOCK
STATEMENT if (exp)
```

**Unless** 

```
Unless is similar to the if statement

unless( condition)

BLOCK

else

BLOCK
```
