## You can change the plan of your current server through Client portal using the following steps:



- Login to client portal from https://portal.serverpoint.com/cgi-bin/gen4cp/engine/login.cgi
- Click "Manage your Vms" 
- Click "Settings of the VM" and click "Upgrade/Downgrade"
- Choose the Appropriate plan and click on 'Apply new Size'. Be aware that changing your virtual server's size will automatically reboot your virtual server.

Note: Its not recommended to downgrade the disk size as it might corrupt the VM.
