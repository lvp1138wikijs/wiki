<p>A CSR is a file containing your certificate application information, including your Public Key. Generate your CSR and then copy and paste the CSR file into the webform in the enrollment process.</p>
<h3><strong>Generate keys and certificate:</strong></h3>
<p>To generate a pair of private key and public Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a domain, use the following command :</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">openssl req -new -nodes -keyout mydomain.key -out domain.csr</code></pre>
<p>This creates a two files. The file mydomain.key contains a private key; do not disclose this file to anyone. Carefully protect the private key.</p>
<p>In particular, be sure to backup the private key, as there is no means to recover it should it be lost. The private key is used as input in the command to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).</p>
<p>You will now be asked to enter details to be entered into your CSR</p>
<p>What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.</p>
<p>For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.</p>
<blockquote>

  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A challenge password ]:
    </li>
    <li>An optional company name ]:</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Use the name of your domain as Common Name (CN).</p>
<p>Check the content of the certificate request file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">openssl req -noout -text -in domain.csr</code></pre>
<p>Your CSR will now have been created. Open the domain.csr in a text editor and copy and paste the contents into the online enrollment form when requested.</p>
