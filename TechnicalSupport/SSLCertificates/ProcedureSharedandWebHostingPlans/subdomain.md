***Please make sure to follow these steps while ordering SSL for sub-domains who's "WHOIS info" is enabled. i.e the domain privacy is enabled.***

    Please be sure to provide the common name for the domain as "www.sub.domain.com" .

    Because it is not possible to load "https://www.sub.domain.com" if the SSL certificate is purchased on "https://sub.domain.com"

    But it is possible to load  https://sub.domain.com and https://www.sub.domain.com if the certificate is  purchased on domain "www.sub.domain.com".

    2. If whois privacy is enabled for the domain.

     The contact email for the domain will be shown as "domain.com@contactprivacy.com". 

     Please note that the validation email can only be sent to an email attached to the domain.

     Like admin@domain.com or administrator/hostmaster/webmaster/postmaster/or support@domain.com.

     Those are the options and is for security reasons to prove they own the domain.

     You have to set the contact email first before purchasing the SSL certificate.
