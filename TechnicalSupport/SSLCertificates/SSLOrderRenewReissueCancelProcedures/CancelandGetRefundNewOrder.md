> **SSL Refund
> CUSTOMER HAVE 30 DAYS TO REQUEST CANCEL AND REFUND**
> 

Goetrust team  is offering 30 days refund policy available for every SSL order. If a customer want to cancel and request refund on recently ordered SSL certificate, then please follow the procedure

To cancel a recently ordered SSL certificate and receive a refund, you would have to do this via the GeoTrust interface:

    Go to the following URL: https://www.geocerts.com/support/cancel

As you would be cancelling this SSL certificate within 30 days of ordering it, this will trigger the refund process on GeoTrust's side, and they will refund to OpenSRS (Our Reseller), and They in turn will refund to our reseller account.

This refund process will take a few days after the end-user cancels the SSL certificate.

Once the cancellation process completed, then contact Ms. Minerva to issue refund to customer or add refund it as credit to customer account.

If customer wants to order a new SSL cert, then he needs to provide us the CSR and the new domain name, address information. In this case, don't need to refund the payment. First cancel the old certificate and then forward the details to Minerva and explain her about the issue and tell her issue an SSL certificate on new domain name.
