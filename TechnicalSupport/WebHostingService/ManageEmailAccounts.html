Check the time <strong>Last time it checked in</strong> with the <strong>current time on db server</strong>.

<h3><span class="text-small">How to setup ServerPoint as my SMTP</span></h3>
<p><span class="text-small">&nbsp;You can use below information.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-small">SMTP Server IP: 72.18.207.136
    SMTP port: 25 (you can also use 26 if your ISP block 25)

    If you use "smtp authentication" then use your email address as username and email account password as password.</span></p>
<h3><span class="text-small">problem in sending emails</span></h3>
<p><span class="text-small">The common problem with email sending is always due to the isp who block port 25, therefore we have configured port 26 for smtp server in our email server,
    you can ask client to use port 25 in smtp server in their email client or use their isp smtp server to send emails.</span></p>
<h3><span class="text-small">Error '550 User does not exist to you'</span></h3>
<p><span class="text-small">Bounced back email is showing error “550 User does not exist to you”
    This means email sending server IP do not have properly Reverse DNS setup.
    This is common security setup of every email server in the world,
    that they do not accept emails from the servers which do not have proper Reverse DNS for their IPs.
    You need to have your customer to contact their email server admin to setup proper rdns for their email server ip.</span></p>
<h3><span class="text-small">Ask client to provide you error message</span></h3>
<p><span class="text-small">If client is having problem and you cannot find any problem related to email address, then ask him/her to provide you the exact error message which he/she is getting from email client. Also ask them for email headers too.</span></p>
<p><span class="text-small">Try to diagnose the problem using that error message, if you cannot then google up with this error message and find the solution.</span></p>

<h3><span class="text-small">553 sorry, that domain isn't in my list of allowed rcpthosts</span></h3>
<p><span class="text-small">It is a silly Outlook issue that has existed for many years. Outlook maintains a nickname list that is used by both the automatic name checking and the automatic completion features. The nickname list is automatically generated while you use Outlook. If the nickname cache is corrupted, Outlook may not be able to identify recipients, may offer incorrect recipients when automatically completing the e-mail address, or may send the message to the wrong person</span></p>
<p><span class="text-small">To resolve this issue just clear Outlook's auto completion cache:</span></p>
