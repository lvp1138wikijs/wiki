Shared accounts under basic and complete plan has setup on shared IPs. Customers can access their account using an url if they do not configured any websites on that shared IP adddress.

You can use the following to access an account via url if they do not have any valid url.

    [domain.com].webserver.[server-host-name]
   Replace domain.com with original domain whcih you want to access and server-host-name with hostname of server which is hosting the domain
