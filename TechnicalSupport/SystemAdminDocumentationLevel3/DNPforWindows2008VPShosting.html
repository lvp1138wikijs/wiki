  &lt;item path="win2008-web-x86"&gt;

<h2>Hyper-V module configuration in DNP</h2>

  Register DNP Server installed on Hyper-V virtualization server by clicking "Add Server" button:

  Specify "Server URL" and "Server password" to the correct values selected during DNP Server installation.

  Enter "DNP Remote Server" license ID into "License" field (you will install Hyper-V module license later) and
  uncheck "Search installer software" checkbox.

  On Server properties screen expand "Licenses" section and add Hyper-V module license. Now make sure you have
  Enterprise-like licenses installed for DNP Enterprise Server. Open "Configuration -&gt; Licenses" page from the top menu
