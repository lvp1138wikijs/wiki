#  Procedure to Ship the Drives to us 
If a customer want to send us a flash drive or drives to connect to the server with us, then use the following details

Here is the address to ship the thumb drive to:

    ServerPoint.com
    300 Carson St
    Suite 100
    Las Vegas, NV, 89101

Customer has to use either Fedex or UPS to ship the drives, as regular postal service may actually not get here. He need to provide us the tracking number once he have it and the expected delivery date. Also this will be under paid support.
