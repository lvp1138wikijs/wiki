<p>There were few customers complained that they have disconnection problem when they try to connect to windows7 cloud VM.</p>
<p>Onapp support said, the problem is because of windows audio redirection to remote desktop client, and the solution is to disable audio redirection in rdp client before accessing windows7 cloud from your pc.</p>
