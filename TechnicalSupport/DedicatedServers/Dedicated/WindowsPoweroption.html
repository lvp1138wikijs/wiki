<p>If any customer reports that his dedicated server performance is low or any benchmark results are not satisfactory or the Clock Speed is not correct, we need to&nbsp; just change the power plan to High Performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, In Windows Power option the plan is set as Balanced or Power Saver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this power plan, the Clock speed will be lower than provided (normally 1.9Ghz).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But once we change the Power plan to high performance the Clock speed will increase to 3.5Ghz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
