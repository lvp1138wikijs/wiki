<p><strong>Solution Related to Servers : Basic Skills</strong></p>
<h4>PING</h4>
<hr>
<p>All data sent over the internet is sent in packets. Consider the following analogy. The idea behind packets is very similar to the idea of the capsules used to send checking and savings information from your vehicle to tellers inside the bank via vacuum tubes. The emails you send and the files you download are all broken down into raw data and inserted into little packets. These packets are piped through your Internet connection. When a packet arrives at a destination computer, the data is extracted and reassembled into a file.</p>
<p>Ping can be used to send packets of information to remote computers for the purpose of retrieving information. These programs are useful for testing your internet connection.</p>
