<p>Sometimes, a process in Linux goes crazy, or the kernel freezes certain processes, and a <strong>“shutdown -rf now”</strong> doesn't do anything and you need to power cycle the machine.</p>
<p>Well, there is a series of commands that actually bypasses that and causes the hardware to do a reset no matter how screwed up Linux is at the moment. Here:</p>
<figure class="table">
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</p>
          <p>echo s &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</p>
          <p>sleep 5</p>
          <p>echo u &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</p>
          <p>sleep 5</p>
          <p>echo b &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</figure>
<p>The process is called the <strong>“magic sysrq key”</strong>. Here is a wikipedia entry about it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key</a></p>
<p>The echo 1, s, u and b all have specific meanings.</p>
