<h1>Email Limit in Shared Account</h1>
<p>Approximately a few thousand emails,&nbsp; as long as the email account is not compromised, not sending a large number of spam emails like thousands of emails per hour which trigger auto-block by other mail servers.</p>
<p>Most important thing is that number of emails and Types of emails don't violate the fair usage policy of popular mail servers like Gmail, Hotmail, etc so our mail server IP doesn't get blocked.</p>
