<p>This a common issue that we come across among the customers mentioning that the Windows websites / Login.live / other Windows logins are not accessible from a Windows VM. Microsoft blocks ips from server providers. Because that login is supposed to be for users at home or in the office to use. Not from inside a data center.</p>
<p>The work around for fixing this issue is by configuring a Windows VPN . Cx may follow the video tutorial from the link below for more details on Windows VPN:</p>
