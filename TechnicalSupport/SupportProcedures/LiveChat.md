# Handling Live chats
Follow the procedures if you get a livechat request.
- 
- Livechat is mostly for sales.
- Anything that involves doing changes to a client's account needs to be on a ticket. Do not handle it via live chat.
- Billing issues are not handled through livechats, but if you get a customer asking for accounting related info:
a) get the info needed and tell customer we will send all info to the registered email in the account
- 
- NEVER provide information about the account like name, card on file, emails, address, password, etc on livechat. If customer is asking for any info, tell him to give you the info and you will have someone from accounting contacting and sending the info needed or validate the info needed via email.
- Never solve accounting issues via livechat that will take to much time and will be prone for errors.
- Don't reset any account passwords or provide any new password just because they ask for. Provide step for then to do it.
- Be aware people could be contacting to try to get info into an account that does not belong to then, competition is quite serious and we need to protect our customers at all cost.

> Note that, accoutning issues are not top priority. If they are in chat you get info and you tell then accounting personnel will validate it all and send info later.
