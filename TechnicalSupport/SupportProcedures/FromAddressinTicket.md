We have to set the correct From address when replying to a ticket. Here is the correct email address of each department. So double check the From address before replying to a ticket.

    Sales - when reply use from address as ticket-sales@serverpoint.com

    Accounting - when reply use from address as ticket-accounting@serverpoint.com

    Webhosting - when reply use from address as ticket-tech@serverpoint.com

    Ded/VPS - when reply use from address as ticket-support@serverpoint.com

    Abuse - when reply use from address as ticket-abuse@serverpoint.com

    When From address is selected as "system-alerts@aplushosting.com" .While customer directly replies to the mail it will be sent to the Gmail Inbox(aplushosting@gmail.com)
