Voice Mail

The sales “department” is not open 24/7. In fact if they call the sales department after hours, it goes to voice mail. Then you will get a ticket opened as ” Voicemail from x-xxx-xxx-xxxx”.
**What to do if a voice mail is received**

    In that ticket you can see .wav file. You will have to hear that .wav file using some media players.

    You will  have to open a ticket to that client and reply for his queries as a new ticket and put voice mail ticket ID as note in the ticket. 

    Once the ticket opened, then take that ticket ID and put it as note in the voice mail ticket and the change voice mail ticket status to "Processed High Load / Alerts"

    If the voice mail is not clear and didn't understand the VM, you can forward to other techs to check voice mail.

    If you understand it but didn't find account details, 

        Google the customer phone number. Google search will also help you to find who sent the voice mail
        Try different strings in icp search like
        951-283-5250
        951 283 5250
        9512835250
        (951) 283-5250

    If you still can't find any details then forward it to Ms. Minerva and explain it and provide customer phone numbers to call them and put a note on voice mail ticket about it.

    If the voice mail is empty, then just change the status to "Processed High Load / Alerts"

    If a voice mail related to new  CLOUD VPS or DEDICATED sales and customer do not have any other account with us, then forward it to Mr. Peter.
