**Do not do compilation for free**
we do not do compilations for free. You can install software from a client as long as it is part of the distribution. That is, anything that is installed by apt-get, yum, emerge or Windows' installed components.

**Issues with cpanel, DA and plesk**
As more and more clients report issues with control panels that you think should be fixed in our master copies, or, set during installation, then you should inform everyone else about the issue and update the Wiki, so that we no longer have to work on those.
