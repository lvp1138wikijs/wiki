# Handle Special Paid Technical Support 
It can be done from new icp Â» Edit clients option
The billing system for support allows to:
 
*charge immediately
*charge in payments (no more than 3 month interval)
*charge on the next payment date (be sure NPD is no more than a month)
*charge in a specific period of time (in no more than 15 days)

Note:Once the customer agrees that the job to be done is not free and he agrees the way he wants to pay, then proceed to do the job. Once job is completed contact customer to let him know amount to be paid and configure payment method on ICP
