**WE NO LONGER OFFER SEARCH ENGINE SUBMISSION: Credits needs to be refund if a customer has it and ask for the service**
> Your submission went through with the engines listed in
> the attachment.  There are still several hundred other
> engines who are in the process of accepting your Web page. 
> Some time will pass until they finish evaluating your
> site.
>  
> You may receive individual confirmation of several of
> these engines by email.
>  
> Feel free to contact us if you have any question.


**Research engine submission**
> This is to inform your that we re-submitted your site to certain search engines
> that didn't accept the submission the first time.
>  
> There are many that are pending, so you will constantly receive notification
> from sites once the submission is accepted with each of them.
>  
> The ideal thing to do is to resubmit your site every three weeks minimum.

**How does it work**
> Well, what you would be purchasing are submission *credits* (each "credit" equal to one
> submission to all the search engines listed in our site).
>  
> You can use those "credits" to submit your site through the control panel whenever you
> like.  You could buy, say,  three "submissions," and then use each one of them when you
> want to.  You are not supposed to use the three at once, after all, it would be a waste
> of time and money for you.
>  
> Once you get listed, resubmit your site any time you make significant changes. Search
> engines should revisit your web site on a regular basic and will update their search
> engine with whatever you changed on your web site. However, some search engines have
> grown smart enough to realize some sites only change content once or twice a year, so
> they may visit less often. Resubmitting after major changes will help ensure that
> your site's content is kept current.
>  
> How long does it take before your Web site is indexed? Well, that depends. Even though
> our service immediately sends your Web page information once it's processed, it takes
> between several days to six weeks for your submission to become part of a listing. Most
> listings will take several weeks since search engines receive many submissions every day.
> Try to avoid making multiple submission to the same site. These people are busy enough
> already and handling duplicate submissions just slows the whole process down for everyone.
> That's one of the reasons it sometimes takes so long to get your website listed.
> If you have any other question, let us know.

**Search engine submission is not automatic**
> Submission is not automatic.  You have to go to your control panel and fill up the
> submission form you find there (which would not appear there if you didn't have any
> submission "credits"). When you submit it we receive it and check everything is in
> order before using our software to process it... so a human looks at it before a
> machine does.  This is necessary since often users do not select the most appropriate
> category for their site, which may lower the amount of search engines to which the
> site is finally submitted. A machine does not have a "sense" of what is "appropriate,"
> it just munches through the data it is fed upon, as always.
>  
> So, yes, you have control of when to begin the submission.  It makes no sense for it
> to be otherwise.
> If you have any other question, let us know.
