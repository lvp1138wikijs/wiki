**Routing problems**
> Every site you access takes a different path through the net. Reaching a site means
> that you are going through hundreds of systems to get there. If one of those systems
> fail, you either can't reach the location, or, it's too slow since some systems can
> redirect you through another path.
>  
> It's a common thing... the best way to diagnose it is to ask a friend or family
> member on some other ISP to try to reach the site.
>  
> Or, go to traceroute.org, and look for a traceroute service as close to where
> you live as possible.
> Our server is just fine .. we have a lot of sites in the same server
> and you are the only one reporting those problems.
>  
> I could access your account via FTP without any problem ...
> I also upload some information (gigantic files)  with a good response time.
>  
> Please try using a different connection. Do you have access to a
> friend's dial up connection? A family member's perhaps?
>  
> Let me know

> Speed is not merely dependent of the speed of the server,
> it is also heavily dependent on the route from your ISP to our
> server (that's called routing problems).  In order to get to our
> server, you have to make several hops in-between. It takes
> only one bad hop to degrade the perceived speed, even over
> cable, DSL , T1. Did you do a traceroute? That would tell you
> where in the route the problem lies. 
> Go to traceroute.org, and look for a traceroute service as close to where
> you live as possible.

**Website claimed to be hacked**
> Such hacking is not done via port scans or anything like that.
>  
> A hack through a script is done usually via unchecked input. If you, for
> example, have a script to create email accounts and you don't check what
> people enter, they could enter something like:
>  
> myname@somedomain.com;rm * -rf
>  
> When you execute the command to create the email address, it will also
> execute the rm command, thus, removing everything on your account.


**Firewalls**
> A firewall is for personal computers, office networks, etc. On a web
> hosting server, a firewall does nothing. A firewall just blocks access
> to a port. On a web hosting server, there are no ports to block as the
> ports used need to be opened for the world to access (like port 80 for
> web access).

**Directory listing request**
> We do provide directory listing for a customer's accounts, but it's not set a default due to security reasons.  If you wish to have directory listing in your account, we would need to have this done manually by our system administrator.
>  
>Please let us know the exact directory name you want to protect.

**If you are not going to help, I will host my site elsewhere**
> Willingness has nothing to do with it, security protocols do, and we will not
> swerve from them.  Unlike Windows servers whose security can be compromised by
> viruses written by anyone, the only way Linux servers can become compromised
> (since viruses do not affect it) is if a malicious user were to get the acces
> codes to the root of the machine. So, while Windows can suffer because of faulty
> code, Linux can suffer through faulty administrators who do not police their
> servers as they should. That's our job, and thousands of (paying) clients depend on that.
>  
> I hope this helps to illustrate our position a bit.
>  
> Please, ask the company to forward us through you (if you will be the one authorized
> from now on to administer the account) the information regarding the check used to pay
> for the account (serial number, date, amount, and the original ID number given to the
> a+ Hosting account if possible). We will use that to authenticate the request and, ergo,
> forward all the information related to the account and update the contact information.
