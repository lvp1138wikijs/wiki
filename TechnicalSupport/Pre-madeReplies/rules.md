## Rules to Follow
## 
    Follow ups need to send to onhold tickets
        For Dedicated/VPS Support and WebHosting Support
            After 24 Hrs
            After 2 days
        For Sales/Accounting
            After 2-3 days
        After one week
        Close at the 2nd week using the closing reply
    Read ticket and document is properly. Which means to make note
        Who customer is
        Summary of problem and solution we provided
        current status, on what is remaining about ticket, Either something was not done from our side, or are we still waiting for customer's confirmation
    If ticket was properly resolved and we got confirmation from customer as well, Request customer to submit feedback
    If ticket was properly resolved from our side, but this was something we are not sure either it fixed customer's issue or not, and we are still waiting for customer to confirm us, Send Follow up email as described in Rule # 1 above.
    Accounting: If Its account related ticket, where customer request us to update his credit card, or charge his invoice or cancel his account etc, And, we updated his credit card, and It was actually updated, his invoice was charged and nothing is due now, or Account was successfully cancel, Request customer to submit feedback
    Sales: If ticket was related to any sales query, and we refuse giving services to customer, then No follow up required. Just close ticket. For example, If a customer asked for multiple ips with his server, but was not able to provide proper justification and we refused him and after that he didnt reply. Then there is nothing to ask him again.
    Sales: If there was some upgrade request from customer, and we did it and customer confirmed back to us as well. Request customer to submit feedback
