We do NOT support nor WORK on software RAID. (We do setup servers with RAID hardware though)

When clients want to set that up, we clearly state that we will NOT support it.

Thus, if someone has a problem with their software RAID, well, tough luck! We will NOT work on it.

Standard answer should always be:
> "Unfortunately, we do not support software RAID. We do not even allow it in our servers"

Any customer that asks to do that, you are well aware that we make them agree to the fact that it is not reliable and that we will not fix it.

Don't waste your time trying to fix such setups! We don't support them!
