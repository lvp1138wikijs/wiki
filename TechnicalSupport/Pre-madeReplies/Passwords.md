# Forgot your password
Which password? Do you mean your control panel password?  Your system/account/FTP password? E-mail password?.
 
If you ever forget your control panel password, then you can reset the password from https://secure.serverpoint.com/cgi-bin/cp/engine/lostpass.cgi.
 
 
Please check it and let us know if you have any further questions.

# Reset Account Control panel Password
Hi,
 
To reset the control panel password please go to www.serverpointapps.com and click on the client portal button. Then click on the lost password link. Put your username or the authorized email address. Our system will send you the details via email. Follow the instruction to reset the password.
 
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

# Forgot password and Contact Email is not valid

Due to security reasons, we would need to authenticate you as owner of  the account.  Since we can not confirm this through the e-mail we have
on file, we would need for you to send us the first 4 and last 4 characters of your registered credit card, so that we can authorize your email address and add
it to your account.
 
If you have any other questions, please let us know

# Forgot system/ftp/front page password
System/ftp/front page passwords are same as your control panel password. If you have forgot your control panel password, then you can reset the password from https://secure.serverpoint.com/cgi-bin/cp/engine/lostpass.cgi.
If you have any questions, just let us know!

# Forgot password and Contact Email is not valid and credit card information is not validating
Due to security reasons, we would need to authenticate you as owner of
    the account.  Since we can not confirm this through the information we have
    on file, we would need for you to send us an authorization form through
    e-mail in order to prove ownership of the account.
     
    The form can be downloaded from the following link:
     
       http://www.serverpoint.com/forms/en/authorization_form_pass.pdf
         
    If you were to send the form through fax, our number is 702-442-1962. Please
    set the scan resolution to the finest setting. This will improve the clarity
    and legibility of the characters and graphics on the faxed document.
     
    We recommend making a photocopy of the form first to make sure the IDs are
    clear and legible. The photocopy will show how it will be received at our end.
     
    Most of our customers send their forms as an attachment and password protected
    for security reasons. This will benefit the customer since it will guarantee
    that the form is received within a minute and it will be accepted by our
    Accounting Department due to its legibility.
         
    If you have any other questions, please let us know!
