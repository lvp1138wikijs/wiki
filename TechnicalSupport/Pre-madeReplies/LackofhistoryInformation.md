#  Lack of history Information 
You didn't include the history of your issue with your e-mail.
With the hundreds of e-mails we receive daily it is simply not humanly
possible to keep track of each and every issue, which is why we ask our clients
to include the thread with their e-mails as long as we are working
on the issue.
 
If we had to dredge our mailboxes every time a client asks for our help
our support would be severely impacted.  So please, keep past information
related to the issue in all your e-mails.

# Lack of password information
You didn't include the password of your server/Accounting with your e-mail.
Please always include your password in the EMail to get a fast reply in your request.

# DNS TRANSFER LACK OF INFORMATION
I'm unable to update de name servers of your domain.  I need the
access codes to the domain management page of your registrar.
 
If you don't have them, ask the company where you purchased your
domain to give them to you to do a DNS transfer. If you manage
your domain at some other place, then send me the link and the
access codes for that place.
 
If for some reason you feel uncomfortable handing us the password
to the domain management page, then feel free to update the name
servers on your own.  More often than not, the process is simple
(besides, it's always a good thing to learn how to deal with that
on one's own).Here are the name servers if you wish to follow that
    route:
 
    Primary Server:
    lasvegas-nv-us.aplushosting.com
    64.235.32.203
 
    Secondary Server:
