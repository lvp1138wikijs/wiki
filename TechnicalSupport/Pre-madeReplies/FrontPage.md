## FP and FTP
> Regardless of the version, because of FP dependency on its extensions,
> it cannot be mixed up with FTP.
>  
> The welcome letter says:
>  
>     NOTE: do not use FrontPage's built-in FTP upload. Doing so can
>     damage your account.
>  
> That means you should use http://yourdomain.com and not ftp://yourdomain.com when
> uploading with FP. The FP extensions do not react well to FTP.   In addition to the numerous
> advantages of the FrontPage publishing approach using http://, there is also less risk of corrupting your
> FrontPage based web site by accidentally destroying internal files used by FrontPage.  The FTP
> option in FP is provided primarily for authoring tools that do not support the FrontPage publishing mechanism.
> In other words:  FP and its extensions do not digest well FTP. For more information, visit Webmonkey:

>  
> The welcome letter than goes on saying:
>  
>     If using FTP to upload your site, be aware that your site must
>     go inside your account's /public_html/ directory. See the
>     following two documents for more information:
>  
> Note the use of "if."  It is implied there, as well as in our FAQ, that FP and FTP are mutually
> exclusive.  You cannot use FP's bells and whistles and use FTP at the same time.
>  
> If you did that you will have to go into your hosting account control panel, Features section, and
> reinstall the extensions (or uninstall/reinstall, if the first doesn't work).  Make sure to read the instructions
> on that page thoroughly before proceeding.  Then, repubish your site if necessary, using http://yourdomain.com.
