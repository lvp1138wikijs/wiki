# Domain Admin contact outdates
Customers can now change the domain admin email address from their client portal.
 
 Login to the client portal and then go to menu >> Domain names.
 Click on the domain name you want to change the admin email address. 
 Unlock the domain name first. To do that click on Lock/Unlock button under the Actions menu.
 Then click on the contact email option and update the admin email address of your domain.
 
Lock the domain name again. The domain admin email address will be changed in next couple of minutes.
Let us know if you have any further questions.
