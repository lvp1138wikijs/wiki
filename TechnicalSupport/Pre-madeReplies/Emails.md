## Someone using my Email to Mail

> Unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done. Remember that they can put any
> address and domain they want on the FROM field of the email software they are
> using to spam out.
>  
> The SMTP protocol was created in an era when these kind of people and activities
> did not exist, thus, there isn't much security in it. Hopefully, a new SMTP
> protocol will be created.
>  
> The only thing you can do is find whoever is doing it. But that too is complex.

## Outlook not opening attachment
> Have you checked Outlook's security settings?
>      
> It might be that the security setting is set to disallow attachments
> to be saved to your computer.  This is caused when Outlook is
> upgraded (specifically to version 6).
>      
>      
> To restore previous setting to go to:
>      
> Tools -> Options -> Security -> "Do not allowed attachments to be saved..."
>      
> Uncheck that box and outlook will allow attachments to be saved
> once again.

> returning are the IPs for c3po.asdf456.com and r2d2.asdf456.com. 
> This is completely wrong.  I'd suggest contacting --------------------
> about this matter.

## 553 error message
> Remember to download (or check for new messages) when trying to send emails.
> Our mail server is not an open relay, in which it does not allow sending email
> through any account unless you have authenticated yourself first.
>  
> Authentication is established each time you check emails. Your IP will be recorded
> for an average of 15 minutes and then it will time out. If you try try sending
> emails during that time, you should have no problem. However, if the authentication
> has timed out, and you try to send an email, you will most likely receive the following
> error message:

## Receiving spams on an Email account
> Unfortunately, we can not block email addresses for our customer's email
> account.  We recommend using filter in your email client to avoid having
> to browse through these anoying emails.
>      
> If you have any questions, just let us know!


## Spam List
> It doesn't matter who's your hosting company,
> it's very difficult to change the mail server's
> IP address since it's used by all customers located
> on that server.  If one of those customer is found
> spamming and is blocked by another server, the whole
> server will be blocked.
>      
> That is why blocking IP addresses is being removed
> from use since all are guilty for one's action.
>      
> Usually, this is temporary.  It all depends on the
> server or service blocking the other end.
>      
> At this moment, we have no control over this since
> we can not simply change the IP address to our
> mail server as indicated in Monkeys.com's Site.
>      
> We're sorry about this, but it's simply out of
> control.  Monkeys.com have been having several
> issues with other companies such as Verio
> as indicated in it's newsgroups
