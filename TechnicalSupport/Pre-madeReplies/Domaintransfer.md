DNS TRANSFER

> Your DNS has been reconfigured. Once NetworkSolutions.com puts the changes into effect,
> you will have to wait at least 72 hours before the information propagates throughout the Web.
> This means the domain name will become unreliable during that period---and that
> includes anything related to the domain name, including e-mails. Since the propagation
> is uneven, you may get e-mails at the old site, in your new site, or not at all. So, if
> possible, do not shut down your site on the other host until you are sure the transfer is
> complete. This is the only way to be minimize downtime to some degree.
>  
> You can monitor these changes using the WHOIS utility at NS
>      
>     http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois
>  
>     or that at http://BetterWhois.com.
>  
> If you have any question, or if the DNS do not change after a reasonable amount of time,
> let us know.
