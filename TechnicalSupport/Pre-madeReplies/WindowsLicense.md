**Q: Can I use my own Windows license?**



> We can't. Unfortunately, this would be a problem for us when reporting to Microsoft the number of licenses we have. That is why we have never allowed it. Plus there's also the logistical issues that not all Microsoft CDs are the same, and they change from time to time. So every time we install a Windows server for you with our CDs, and your license turns out to not work on that installation, we have to spend more time having you give us the ISOs and doing manul re-installations.
> 
> It's just not possible. We have to deal with thousands of servers and we can't introduce elements into the operation that require manual intervention.
> 
> Plus then there's the audits from Microsoft, where we would have to report all licenses owned by clients, forcing us to add more interfaces to our databases or manual ways to keep track of all those licenses, when installed, and also whenever a server gets cancelled, we would have to check if that client had his own license to remove it from our database, etc.
> 
> Logistically, allowing clients to use their own licenses is not as simple and would be prone to human error.
> 
> As for the price, I can tell you its close to what we offer it to clients. On that again we can't do different prices for different customers as it would be more manual elements into an already complex operation.
> 
> As for the actual cost, that is of course protected under a non disclosure agreement. We can't tell you what it is.
> 
> You can try our new ColossusCloud product where licenses are less expensive, but you still have to pay for them.
