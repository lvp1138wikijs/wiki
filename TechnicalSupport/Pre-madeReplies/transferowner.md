> Hi,

> Remember that even though you do not have an account with us, you can keep your domain in our registrar.
> In that case we will help you with any  change you need like DNS and contact info and we will also contact you when the domain is up for renewal.
> We are very careful with all domain to avoid domain theft so you do not have to worry about that :)


**Reply if customer continue with transfer**
>  Hi,

> If you want to still transfer the domain , you have to initiate the transfer request from your future hosting or registrar company.
> Let us know if you face any issues.

        The only reason to customer contact us is if the domain is lock . Nothing else.
