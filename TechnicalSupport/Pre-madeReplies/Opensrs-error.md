# 552 Domain status does not allow for operation
# 
If openSRS transfer failed and returned the following error message

 We can not process this transfer due to a 552 error from the registry.

This can occur as a result of :

    domain is not yet 60 days old in the current registrar
    existing registrar has the name locked for either non-payment or at the end users request
        requesting party needs to contact existing registrar to resolve
    domain name is in dispute
    the name has been deleted
