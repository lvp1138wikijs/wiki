If a customer has 2 accounts and want to move a Domain name registration from one user account to the other one, inform Minerva.

(Move a Domain name registration means, moving a domain name from 'CP >> Menu >> Domain Names' section of one username to another username of same customer)

Please make sure that both the accounts belong to same customer (validate the customer).
