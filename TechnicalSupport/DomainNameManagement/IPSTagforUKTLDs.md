In order to transfer a .UK domain to Tucows, the domain owner must first contact the current Registrar and ask them to change the IPS Tag to “TUCOWS-CA“.  If the current Registrar is unable or unwilling to make the change, Customer need to contact Nominet directly (http://www.nominet.org.uk) and they will help make the change.

More information about transfers and changes in ownership for .UK domains is available directly from Nominet (http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/manage-your-domain/transfer)
