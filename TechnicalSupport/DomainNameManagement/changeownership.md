To change the contact information:

Log into https://manage.opensrs.net and click on the Organization link and update the information.

Youâ€™ll also probably want to change the username/password to something different using the following method:

    Log into https://manage.opensrs.net
    Click on the Manage Profile link
    Click on Change Ownership of Domain
    Enter in a new username and password that will be used to access the domain
    Click on Change Owner

> If you have a grouped domain profile with multiple domains all grouped together, it is important to remember that anyone with the login information can change all the contacts/ownership information for all the domains in that profile. Ensure you move the domain out of the group profile first before giving the username/password to someone else.
