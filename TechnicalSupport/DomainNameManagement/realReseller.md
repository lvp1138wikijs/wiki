We are not the only resellers from opensrs, there are many. And if you have doubts on any customer account then tucows whois will give you the info.

Go to http://www.tucowsdomains.com/whois
and find out who is the real reseller for this account.

Other way is to go to http://manage.opensrs.net
Enter domain and some wrong username/password. Then you will get reseller name for that domain.
