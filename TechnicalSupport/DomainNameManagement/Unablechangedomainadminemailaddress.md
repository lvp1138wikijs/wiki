These are the 2 options to validate in openSRS in order to change the domain admin email

- The admin email wonâ€™t be changed for security reason unless it is validated from the old email

- From the phone number on file. .

We can change the phone number if needed by manually entering the phone number in which we can receive the verification email.

- click "Resend verification to current registrar" button
and an option to send the approval by SMS will be displayed

- This field can be modified and you can enter the new number
