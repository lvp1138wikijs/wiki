Reply to customer:
Your domain is in redemption period. Several alerts were sent but we never hear from you.
It has now passed its expiry period and now fallen in redemption.

If your domain enters such period, the registrar will require a $120 payment to recover the domain.

Redemption period is the Grace Period of the domain for 30 days. Whois information (name, address, telephone numbers, etc.) will be deleted. The domain 
will still be inactive. The domain may be renewed by it's original owner for a very high fee. It is a manual process for the registry to add the 
name/address information back into the domain registry records, therefore, the process may take several days.

Five days after the end of the redemption period the domain name will be deleted from the registry and will be made available for anyone to register.

Remember that decisions made by the domain's registrar, the company that handles your domain on the global Internet, is not the responsibility of your host.

If you wish to get your domain out of redemption period, contact us asap.
