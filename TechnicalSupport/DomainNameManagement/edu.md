# What are .edu domains?
Edu domains are those domains ending in .edu.

The majority of .edu domains are associated with an American post-secondary educational institution, such as a college or university.

The domain name registrations for .edu are restricted to accredited post secondary educational institutions in the United States.

The registry operations of the domain name are operated by EDUCAUSE ( https://net.educause.edu/edudomain/ ) through a Cooperative Agreement granted by the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), which is the final authority regarding the membership and operations of the .edu domain space.

We can't register the .edu domain through our reseller panel. Simply its not possible.
