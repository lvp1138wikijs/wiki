<p><strong>If a Domain name was not validated by customer and got suspended</strong></p>
<p>In such a situation, customer needs to approve the validation email sent to domain's contact email address. It is important that they keep their domain's contact email address up to date. Every year, Opensrs will send a validation email to the email address to make sure it is valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the 'contact email' is not accessible, then an SMS message can be sent to the mobile device to get this domain name validated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, both contact email and phone number validation is not possible. Then we can update the contact email from Reseller Opensrs panel (https://manage.opensrs.com).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Only Peter and Minerva is having access to this portal, so this needs to be done, either by Peter or Minerva]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[ALSO: It is in their NEW panel (Not the old panel)]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to follow to change the contact email is as given below:</p>
<p>1) Login to NEW Reseller Opensrs panel (https://manage.opensrs.com).</p>
<p>2) Need to "Cancel Trade". It is on Domain's page.</p>
<p>Take the Domain's page &gt;&gt; Contact Information Line &gt;&gt; You would then input the changes to the Owner</p>
<p>3)Click on "edit contact information"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Accept the changes, then you would see the attached image</p>
<p>5) When you choose to waive email confirmation, it will no longer need their confirmation, you will need their IP address (Can get customer's IP from checking the 'last time the customer logged in to our panel')</p>
