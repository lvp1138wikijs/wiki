<p>These are the 2 options to validate in OpenSRS in order to change the domain admin email</p>
<ol>
  <li>The admin email wonâ€™t be changed for security reason unless it is validated from the old email</li>
  <li>From the phone number on file.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can change the phone number if needed by manually entering the phone number in which we can receive the verification email.</p>
<p>- Click "Resend verification to current registrar" button and an option to send the approval by SMS will be displayed</p>
<p>- This field can be modified and you can enter the new number</p>
