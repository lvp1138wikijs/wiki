<p>In order to transfer a .UK domain to Tucows, the domain owner must first contact the current Registrar and ask them to change the IPS Tag to “TUCOWS-CA“. &nbsp;If the current Registrar is unable or unwilling to make the change, Customer need to contact Nominet directly and they will help make the change.</p>
<p>More information about transfers and changes in ownership for .UK domains is available directly from Nominet:</p>
