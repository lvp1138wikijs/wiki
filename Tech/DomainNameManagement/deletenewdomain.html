<p>Opensrs offer refund for new gTLD domain registrations only if the domain is revoked within 4 days of registration. A processing fee is applied to the domain refund</p>
<p>So if a customer want to delete the recently registered then we can contact Opensrs team through our reseller management panel. Then cancel the domain and request for refund. Minerva can do that. Please contact her to submit cancellation and refund request through OpenSRS reseller panel. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This same procedure can be used for fraud account too.</strong></p>
<p>For fraud account: Once we identified the customer as fraud then cancel the account and contact Minerva to cancel the domain registration and refund.</p>
