<p>Domain can be renewed using the New ClientPortal even though the account is already cancelled and there is no active hosting account. You can use the same steps mentioned above for Active Accounts.</p>

<p><u>Domain in Redemption Period</u></p>
<h6>Redemption</h6>
<h6>Max Limit of redemption period is 70 day after expiration date</h6>
<h6>The domain exceed the limit, then customer has to contact opensrs directly to renew this.</h6>

<p><span class="text-small"><i>Your domain is in redemption period. Several alerts were sent but we never hear from you.</i></span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>It has now passed its expiry period and now fallen in redemption. If your domain enters such period, the registrar will require a $120 payment to recover the domain.</i></span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>Redemption period is the Grace Period of the domain for 30 days. Whois information (name, address, telephone numbers, etc.) will be deleted. The domain will still be inactive. The domain may be renewed by it's original owner for a very high fee. It is a manual process for the registry to add the name/address information back into the domain registry records, therefore, the process may take several days.</i></span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>Five days after the end of the redemption period the domain name will be deleted from the registry and will be made available for anyone to register.</i></span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>Remember that decisions made by the domain's registrar, the company that handles your domain on the global Internet, is not the responsibility of your host.</i></span></p>
<p><span class="text-small"><i>If you wish to get your domain out of redemption period, contact us asap.</i></span></p>
