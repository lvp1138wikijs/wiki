  <p>We are not the only resellers from opensrs, there are many. And if you have doubts on any customer account then tucows whois will give you the info.</p>

<p>- Go to http://www.tucowsdomains.com/whois and find out who is the real reseller for this account.</p>
<p>- Other way is to go to http://manage.opensrs.net</p>
<p>&nbsp; Enter domain and some wrong username/password. Then you will get reseller name for that domain.</p>
